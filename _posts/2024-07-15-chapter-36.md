The group wakes to the sounds of the jungle coming alive. Chirps and clicks begin to erupt from
unseen birds, the guttural croak of a frog somewhere off in the distance, and the slow rythmic
buzzing of insects adds to nature's symphony. Through it all, a distant howler monkey's mournful
call hangs heavy in the humid air, a slightly haunting start to the new day.

After a brief breakfast of trail rations, they proceed towards the mountain temple in the same
order as yesterday. Dolor leads them, cutting back vines and vegetation with a machete, followed
closely by Bilwin and Mond. Grindlefoot scampers along the path as lightly as the previous day,
unhindered by the dense plant growth, and Gven continues to battle the branches that snap back
to attention after his passing.

"Hey farmer, would you mind not aiming every single twig at my face! I could keep a better eye
on our path and how to get back to the cove if I didn't have to fight the jungle too."

Grindlefoot pauses for a second and looks at Gven, only realizing in that moment that he was
causing her any discomfort at all. "Oh, you don't need to worry about getting back there, I'm
a [Wanderer](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/background:outlander#toc2). I could lead us back there
with my eyes closed." He points off in the general direction they've traveled from, then just
as quickly returns to following Mond and the others. "Isn't this jungle great! It's almost like
it wants us to walk this way by making it so easy!" Gven groans as another branch smacks her
in the face.

Around midday, after several hours of walking, they approach a large gorge, roughly 200 feet
across to the other side and 100 feet to the bottom. Dolor turns to Bilwin, "does that map of
yours show anything about this gorge or the easiest way to get to the other side?"

"Ah, isn't that map a beautiful specimen of cartography. I could get lost in it for hours, along
with a nice tasty beer, of course. But no, it doesn't show much detail about this gorge, other
than the river at the bottom running across the island. Although, I remember from our air
reconnaissance that there's a bridge somewhere close to here. Otherwise, it's probably a day's
walk either way to get around it. I think the bridge is in that direction," and Bilwin points
towards the east.

Following Bilwin's direction and walking within the cover of the jungle, they soon catch sight
of a stone bridge that spans the gorge. A cacophony of monkeys grows louder as they get closer
to the bridge. They can now see that the bridge has statues of monkeys lining the sides every
20 or 30 feet. Surprising them, a deep laugh emanates from the gorge below them and the
monkeys quiet down momentarily, whether out of fear or respect, they're uncertain.

Approaching the bridge, they can see that an ancient road is now overgrown by the jungle
plants, only passable by the monkeys and other native animals. The bridge's stone sides are
covered in intricate carvings with geometric themes. Looking towards the other side of the
gorge, they see a large stone statue of a kneeling warrior at the halfway point. A human
skeleton rests at the base of the statue.

Off towards the west a few miles away, Dolor spies a rock floating a few hundred
feet above the river in the middle of the gorge. "Gven, can you make out anything with that
oddly placed rock?"

Looking toward the rock and embracing her
[totem warrior](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior)'s Eagle
[aspect of the beast](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior#toc2),
Gven is able to see the floating boulder fairly well, but it's still too far for most details.
"There's a tree living on it and the rock appears to be a little bigger than the root ball.
I don't see anything else of note, but then...a floating rock with a tree is noteworthy, all
on its own."

Mond speaks up, "I believe that's an [earthmote](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Earthmote).
It's held aloft by strong magic that cannot be dispelled. Hmm, could be interesting to explore
it further, when we have time, that is."

Turning back to the bridge, Dolor fires an arrow at the warrior statue to see if it triggers
any movement or spells. Nothing happens in response, so the group begins to cross.

Curious about the geometric markings on the bridge's stone railings, Bilwin stops to investigate
them and thinks that they resemble mazes. Looking closer, he finds references to the gods
[Moradin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Moradin) and
[Ubtao](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ubtao), but isn't sure how that relates
to the bridge or the gorge a hundred feet below them.

As they approach the halfway point, about 40 feet from the statue, it suddenly stands up and
in a booming, deep voice says "You are not worthy."

Gven quickly responds with "and who are you to deem us unworthy?" She moves within striking
distance of the animated stone warrior and invokes her
[barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/),
holding Tempest's Edge at the ready.

## Fight choreography

<!-- Initiative rolls:
  Bilwin - 17
  Dolor - 9
  Grindlefoot - 8
  Gven - 22
  Mond - 7
-->

<!-- Round 1 -->
* Gven - Stands ready to respond to any attack from the [stone golem](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17025-stone-golem).
* Bilwin - Bows towards the stone warrior and humbly says, "we apologize for intruding on your
  space, this, umm, lovely bridge made of fine solid rock and wish to pass in peace." His attempt
  to persuade fails, so he casts [Shield of Faith](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2248-shield-of-faith)
  in front of Gven.
* Dolor - Moves to stand next to Gven, holding Gleaming Blade at the ready.
* Grindlefoot - Slowly backs up while preparing [Entangle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2085-entangle)
  for the first sign of the golem's movement.
* Mond - Cautiously backs away from the group, allowing some distance for him to cast a spell.
* Golem - Moving only its right arm, it smacks Gven across the face for 9 bludgeoning damage.
  * Dolor - Reacts immediately and swings Gleaming Blade at the beast, causing 19 damage.
  * Golem - On its backswing from hitting Gven, it smacks Dolor and causes 13 damage.
  * Dolor - As is his way, automatically responds with [Hellish Rebuke](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hellish-rebuke),
    causing 20 damage to the golem.
* Grindlefoot - Responding to the golem's attack, casts [Entangle](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2085-entangle),
  but it fails to grapple the stone warrior.

<!-- Round 2 -->
* Gven - Misses with both swings of Tempest Edge.
* Bilwin - Casts [Guiding Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2133-guiding-bolt) and misses.
  * He then casts [Spiritual Weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon),
    which attacks the golem and causes 5 force damage.
* Dolor - Swings Gleaming Blade at the stone warrior and connects for 19 damage.
  * He then attacks with his second short sword in his off hand, causing 10 damage, but
    it doesn't appear to impact the golem.
* Grindlefoot - Casts [Healing Word](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2140-healing-word) at Gven,
  for 4 in healing.
  * He then [Wild Shapes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/635-druid-101-wild-shape-guide)
    into a [giant ape](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16873-giant-ape) and moves closer.
* Mond - Casts [Lightning Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2167-lightning-bolt) for 29 damage.
* Golem - Palm strikes Dolor for 10 bludgeon damage and then misses Dolor on its backswing.

<!-- Round 3 -->
* Gven - Swings her glowing longsword at the golem, causing 16 damage with her first strike and
  missing with her second.
* Bilwin - [Blesses](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2016-bless) the others, assisting with their
  attacks and saves.
  * He quickly casts [Bardic inspiration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/1-bard#BardicInspiration-75) at Mond.
  * The spiritual weapon attacks the golem and causes 10 damage.
* Dolor - Focuses on attacking only with his magical short sword and connects for 18 damage, then
  quickly uses [Second Wind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/10-fighter#SecondWind-192) to regain 5 health.
* Grindlefoot - As an ape, he jumps around everyone to attack and misses. He realizes that
  as a halfling he knows martial arts and decides to create _Kung Fu Monkey_ style. Unfortunately,
  the non-magical attack doesn't hurt the golem.
* Mond - Casts [Burning Hands](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2021-burning-hands) for 18 damage
  and the 8 foot tall stone golem suddenly crumbles to the ground amidst the sheet of flames erupting
  from Mond's hands.

Sliding Gleaming Blade into its scabbard, Dolor quietly says, "not worthy, my ass." 

Continuing across the bridge, they discover that the last twenty feet has crumbled and
fallen into the gorge below. Fortunately, Grindlefoot is still in the shape of a giant ape
and scrambles across the gap while carrying one end of a length of rope. Returning to his
halfling form, he ties off the rope to a tree while Dolor secures the other end to part
of the stone bridge.

Before they cross the rope, Bilwin casts [Feather Fall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2095-feather-fall)
on the adventurers, then he and Mond make it across quickly. When Dolor reaches halfway,
he loses his balance and begins to slowly fall away. Moving quicker than anyone expected,
Gven is able to shimmy across the rope and grab Dolor before he's out of reach, saving him
from a hundred foot fall to the gorge below.

They continue on for the rest of the afternoon, attempting to follow the ancient overgrown
road while moving towards the mountain temple as best they can.
