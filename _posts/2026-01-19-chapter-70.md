As the echo from Figaro's bellow fades into silence, Illren enters the room with a beaming smile
on his face. "Figaro! You seem more well! Nothing makes my heart sing more than this news!

The tiefling turns to glare at the acting first mate, "You are not who you say you are."
Illren opens his hands in a non-threatening manner and silently gives a confused look.

"Drop the disguise."

"I know not what you speak of. It is I, your companion and friend. Many trials we have faced together,
fought and lived through battles."

Figaro turns to Kycera, sitting next to him on the bedside, "He's a monster!"

The orc turns a threatening scowl towards the Giff and in a hoarse whisper, "Illren, what have you been doing?"

"To keep us safe, everything I can! I've been the main stick of this ship, keeping everyone alive! You
know not what you speak of, your illness affects your mind."

Gven quietly slides one of her daggers into a hand, ready for combat in the close quarters of the state room, if necessary.

Kycera moves to stand up, "I think we better step outside. Figaro needs to rest, for real."

Bilwin moves his hands slightly, keeping them close to his waist and out of sight from Illren.
"Come now, my friendly sailor. We know _something's_ going on, and you know we know, so you
also know we're going to find out, one way or another. I
[suggest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619101-suggestion) you reveal the truth of what
you're doing on this ship with the crew. We need to know the something that you know."

Illren grimaces in pain, at first it seems mild, then it grows and his face turns into a visage of
torture as he fights the compulsion to reveal his secret. His body shimmers and morphs into another shape,
with a similar height and size. The massive beast is [frog-like](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Slaad)
and stands on its hind legs, in humanoid fashion. Horns run from the center of its forehead, across the top of its head,
and down its back, each one extending five to ten inches out from its skin. More horns are visible along its
shoulders, like built-in paldrons, with smaller ones running down its upper arms. The arms extend to the
ground, even with it standing vertical, and the three large fingers on each end in deadly sharp claws.

Illren roars in defiance and rushes from the room, knocking Bilwin out of the way and heading towards the
stairs.

Gven turns to Kycera, "It's your ship, what do you want us to do?"

The orc responds in a low growl, "Get that fucker!"

<!-- Fight choreography -->

<!-- Initiative rolls:
  Bilwin - 6
  Dolor - 7
  Grindlefoot - 19
  Gven - 20
  Mond - 16
-->

<!-- Round 1 -->

At the fastest speed she can manage through the narrow halls and steep stairs of the Lambent Zenith, Gven
dashes after the beast formerly known as Illren. She makes it back through the mess deck and two flights of
stairs to the top deck, where she sees the creature standing close to the main mast. The barbarian
[invokes her rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/) while the
creature appears confused about what to do next. It looks around, searching for its escape when it notices
the half-orc on deck.

"I will feed!"

It rushes Gven, slashing at her face with the lengthy claws on one hand, narrowly missing as she twists to her
side and backwards. She doesn't have time to avoid the other hand and the sharp claws slip through the open front
of her coat, cutting into flesh through her shirt. Before she can recover from the successful attack, it pulls close
and bites her neck, the sharp teeth puncturing her skin. Within seconds, both of Gven's wounds begin to show signs
of decay and withering flesh.

Feeling the necrotic wound on her neck, "What sort of bastardly beast are you?"

Bilwin appears at the top of the stairs in time to hear Gven's curse and see the creature pull away from its bite.
An [ornate beer stein](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon) suddenly appears floating next to
the cleric and swiftly flies to within a few feet of the creature. The beast stares at the hovering mug in confusion,
then a powerful force smacks it along its shoulder and it grunts in pain.

<!-- Round 1 damage:
  Bilwin - 0
  Dolor - 0
  Grindlefoot - 0
  Gven - 21, 12 necrotic
  Mond - 0
-->

<!-- Round 2 -->

The half-orc grabs a healing potion from her belt and swigs it, immediately feeling some of her strength returning
and her wounds smooth over, leaving the congealed blood on her skin. Tucking the dagger into her belt, she draws
Tempest Edge from its sheath across her back. The creature's bulbous head moves quickly, evading the greatsword's
first swing. Baring her tusks and gritting her teeth, the half-orc deftly reverses the blade's direction and catches
the beast by surprise, slicing through the upper portion of its leg.

A moment later, Grindlefoot emerges from below to the top deck and sees Gven injured and standing alone against
the creature. The druid mutters a few [healing words](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619143-healing-word)
and the barbarian feels another surge of strength return. A second later, without much concious effort, the
halfling [Wild Shapes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/635-druid-101-wild-shape-guide) into a 
[giant wolf spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16900-giant-wolf-spider) and moves to the side of the deck.

Mond reaches the top deck immediately behind the halfling and steps to the side of the doorway, allowing those behind
him freedom to join the fight. The sorcerer raises both hands to waist level and a
[bolt of lightning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618999-lightning-bolt) arcs toward their enemy. The pink
lightning reaches its chest and turns wild circles around its torso for several seconds. It screams out in agony.

Standing next to Illren's beast, Gven notices that some of the wounds she and the others have inflicted are healing
on their own. Under her breath, "What the hell's next? This damned thing can heal itself too!"

It's difficult to read any intent or emotion in the amphibious eyes, but the half-orc is close enough to think
that she sees the glimmer of a deadly smile in them. One webbed hand turns upright and a spark appears, floating
just above its palm. It tosses the [small ball of fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618887-fireball)
over Gven's head so that it lands between her, Mond, and Bilwin.

Fortunately, Mond saw the small spark at the same time as Gven and is able to
[counter the spell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619072-counterspell). Bilwin watches the small spark travel
over the barbarian's head, growing in size as it begins its descent to the deck. Just as its about to touch
the wooden decking and explode into a fiery mess, it dissolves with a puff of smoke. The creature roars in anger
at the thwarted attack.

Dolor exits the door from the lower decks and sees the spark of fire go poof. The warlock quickly realizes they're
under magical attack and hurls three [beams of light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619161-eldritch-blast)
at the beast in quick succession. From the teifling's position by the door he has an obscured view of Illren; Gven
is up close in melee combat and the others are dispersed around the deck. The first two beams slam into its muscular
body, the crackling energy briefly sizzling its flesh. The final attack goes slightly wide, missing the beast—and
Dolor's companions, thankfully.

Bilwin moves along the deck rail to gain a clear shot and releases a
[bolt of light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt) that shocks his companions with its intensity.
The cleric has cast this spell dozens of times and never before has it been so bright or intense. The mass of energy
slams into the creature, pushing it backwards several feet, sliding across the deck. The amphibious body is covered in
charred skin and the creature screams out in anguish and anger. A few seconds later, Bilwin sees portions of the skin
smooth over from some sort of natural healing ability.

<!-- Round 2 damage:
  Bilwin - 0
  Dolor - 0
  Grindlefoot - 0
  Gven - 0
  Mond - 0
-->

<!-- Round 3 -->

Seizing the opportunity, Gven lunges at Illren, stabbing it through one of its legs. It recoils in pain and narrowly
evades her follow up attack, a slash at its arm. The barbarian snarls at the beast, cracking the dried blood on her
cheek from its earlier attack—thankfully healed by Grindlefoot.

From a siderail, Grindlefoot—in the body of the large spider—shoots webbing at the beast, attempting to ensnare and
restrain it. Illren dodges the silk trap and then sees the spider scurry over the railing, out of sight on the outside
of the hull.

Mond looks to the creature and focuses his mind into a force of
[dominance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619148-dominate-person). With as much mental force as he can muster,
the sorcerer sends the telepathic message, "Stop attacking."

All of the companions hear the creature's telepathic response, "Your arcane tricks do not work on me, sorcerer."
Enraged at being hurt so badly by the dwarven cleric's guiding bolt, Illren roars in defiance. A spark
appears in its hand and he tosses a [tiny bit of fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618887-fireball) so that it
arcs to land in the companions' midst. And once again, Mond
[dissipates the fireball]((https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619072-counterspell)), turning it into nothing but a
puff of smoke.

Before the beast can react, Dolor slings three more [light beams light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619161-eldritch-blast)
at it. The first one barely misses, sliding between its arm and torso, but the other two slam into its body with
enough force to drop it to its knees, if only for a moment.

Taking advantage of its vulnerable position, Bilwin rushes with his battle axe held high. The momentum from his
advance adds to the force of the blade cutting through Illren's shoulder, easily slicing through tendons and muscle.
The floating [beer stein](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon) moves in the air next to the
cleric. As soon as the dwarf pulls his axe away, the stein smacks itself up against back of the creature's head.
The beast looks to the side, wondering what attacked him, and swipes at the stein with little effort, missing it
completely.

<!-- Round 3 damage:
  Bilwin - 0
  Dolor - 0
  Grindlefoot - 0
  Gven - 0
  Mond - 0
-->

<!-- Round 4 -->

The creature is obviously hurt and close to the end of its ability to fight, but Gven has been in this situation
before and knows not to underestimate a cornered opponent. With the expert skill from years of training and experience,
she deftly slices through one of Illren's forearms, severing its hand.

From the outside hull, Grindelfoot—in spider form—suddenly climbs over the railing and launches himself at the
suffering creature. The large spider bites Illren on his shoulder blade, drawing blood and poisoning the frog-like
beast. It claws at the spider, trying to gain a hold, but Grindlefoot is too fast and pulls away.

Mond moves closer towards the beast and a [toxic mist](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618875-poison-spray)
emits from his extended hand, spraying the beast in the face. It drops to its knees, the pain obvious in its face
from the poison quickly spreading through its body. Within seconds, its eyes gloss over and its corpse falls
to the deck.

"Damnit, I wanted to question it, not kill it!"

Bilwin deadpans, "Maybe next time don't use something so deadly, like, um, poison?"

---

Figaro and Kycera emerge from below deck and take in the scene before them. The real first mate is still shaking
from his experience, being under the monster's complete control for months, and walks slowly over to its corpse.
Standing over its head, the exhausted tiefling looks down silently at the bulbous body for a solid minute, lost in
his thoughts. As Kycera crosses the deck to join him, he begins kicking Illren's body over and over. His pent up
anger comes out in a flurry of lashes and stomps that have little affect on the beast.

Kycera reaches him and rests a hand on his shoulder, "What was that?"

Figaro stills his attack, "It's a [slaad](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Slaad). They feed on fear.
Illren called those cloakers to the ship to make us afraid, so he could feed. I caught him shape shifting one
day and that's when he started messing with my head." He looks up to Kycera, "You have no idea what it's like
to forget what you know, to doubt your own thoughts and memories. To see one thing and question it's reality.
It's terrifying."

He turns to the companions and bows his head, "You have my gratitude. Now, who are you and why are you here?"

Dolor tells the first mate an abridged version of their tale and the crew collaborates its veracity, at least
to the best of their knowledge.

"I know what you speak of. The captain found a magical device that creates portals for traveling. It shortened our
voyages, so much so that we began swimming in coin. The portals were safe," his face takes on a look of guilt, "
until they weren't. It's all my fault. I knew this area was dangerous, that we could get caught in _something_,
but I didn't say anything."

Kycera gives him a harsh look, "That was stupid. You're the first mate, it's your responsibility to advise the
captain and keep us afloat. Crew have died. Not to mention the bullshit that Illren put us through. I suppose
you've been punished enough, but you need to tell the captain when we see her."

_The group has learned the secret of Figaro, that he knew about the dangers in this area of the Astral Sea but
hid the information from the captain._

Dolor speaks up, "Speaking of the captain. Kycera told us about the magic item and the wards, but we don't know
how to circumvent their security. Can you help us?"

Figaro gives a stern look towards Kycera, "That was supposed to be top secret!" She shrugs and he rolls his eyes
then continues, "Yes, the wards are invisible. Use a spell or some other means to reveal them in the state room
below deck and in the study on the starboard section of the vessel."

<!-- The following is AI Overview of "describe the Lambent Zenith from Vecna Eve of Ruin"
  The Lambent Zenith (Zambient) is a crashed spelljamming galleon in the Astral Plane, central to Chapter 3 of Vecna: Eve of Ruin, where adventurers explore its wreckage, fragmented and embedded in the body of a dead god (Havok) to find the Second Fragment of the Rod of Seven Parts. This once-grand ship, captained by Inda Malayuri and powered by the Rod, was destroyed by Vecna, its pieces scattered amidst the god's corpse, now home to monsters and perils. 
Key Aspects:
   - Ship Type: A large, magical space-faring galleon, a "spelljammer".
   - Location: Adrift in the Astral Sea, specifically within the corpse of the dead god Havok.
   - Condition: Shattered into three main pieces (sterncastle, starboard section, prow) by the catastrophic impact, with parts lodged in the god's anatomy.
   - Crew: 
     - Inda Malayuri: captain
     - Figaro: first mate (locked himself in captain's cabin)
     - Illren: second mate, acting captain, male Giff (Space Hippo - https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Giff)

     - Lysan: crew member who initially finds them, Zastra's sister, female Githyanki (https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Githyanki)
     - Kycera: female orc
     - Daveras: male elf, druid
   - Purpose in Adventure: Serves as a multi-layered dungeon crawl, a dangerous environment where players navigate wreckage, fight astral predators, and seek the next Rod of Seven Parts fragment.
   - History: Transporting passengers between planes when it encountered Vecna's destruction, leading to its demise and the scattering of its crew.
   - Visuals: Described as chaotic, with golden sails, glowing cosmic energy, and remnants of immense divine flesh. 

  In essence, the Lambent Zenith is a dynamic, multi-part shipwreck environment that players must explore to advance their quest against Vecna.
