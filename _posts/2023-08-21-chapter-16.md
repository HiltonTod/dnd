_For brevity's sake, the narrator has left out much of the dialog and banter, although it was
quite entertaining in the moments._

It's early afternoon, several hours before dusk will begin to takeover the day, as the adventurers
approach the Pride of the Coast, Elsemar. Before reaching the gates, they pass through the Shade,
a seeming overflow of people, homes, and businesses from the city proper, that sidles right up to the
city walls. After 15 minutes of walking, they reach the gates, open during peace time yet guarded
by the city watch, dressed in the city's deep purple and bright silver livery.

About twenty feet in front of the main gate is an arch across the last stretch of The Ha-derech.
The group stops at a building a short distance from the arch and see that all of the travelers are
walking through it. A guard standing in the center of the road, between the arch and the gate, trains
a sharp eye on each visitor as they pass through. Every once in awhile, they direct a traveler off
to the side of the road for questioning or tell them to register with the Hall of Records.

As the adventurers proceed through the archway, the guard stops them for questioning. Within a few
minutes, they direct Dolor and Bilwin to register their magical items: Dolor's sword, Gleaming Blade,
and Bilwin's ever-filled beer stein. The guard turns to Mond and asks if he's already registered in
the city or has papers to enter. Admitting that he has neither, Mond is ordered to go directly to
the Hall of Records and register. If he doesn't comply, the city guard will have to take _precautionary
measures_, as the guard points to others along the wall with arrows knocked and pointed at Mond.

The group proceeds through the Scrivener's Burrough, immediately beyond the gate and the Pride and
Comfort's stables, to register Mond. Only if he files the proper paperwork with the city registrants,
will he be allowed to stay.

As they enter the Hall of Records, he adventurers see several members of the Eyes of the Star and
Hands of the Wand walking around, usually in pairs talking in a semi-hushed manner, implying that
others shouldn't be eavesdropping yet not too concerned about the possibility within these walls.

Off to the side from the entrance, a [tortle](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Tortle_(5e_Race_Variant))
greets them, "Awright stranger, howfur kin ah hulp ye? ah, ah see that ye, young half-elf, need
tae set yersel' up. That is, unless ye'r interested in joining th' Hauns o' th' Wand. Ainlie a nine
year commitment!"

Mond politely declines the invitation to enlist and pays the animated tortoise 25 gold pieces for
a 7-day pass, with the option to renew for 5 gold pieces—only before the pass expires.

Exiting the Hall of Records, they head towards the market to begin their search for lodging and
news of Gven's brother, Torp. Meandering through the various booths and vendors, their uncertainty
is apparent to many. A [tabaxi](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Tabaxi_(5e_Race_Variant))
with black fur, except for a wide patch of white running down the middle of its body from head
to feet, approaches them and offers their assistance.

"My name is Rightside and I know Elsemar like the back of my paw," as he gives his left paw a few
quick licks and then wipes one of his whispers. "I can help ya find what you need or who you be
looking for." After some back and forth between the tabaxi and the group, they settle on 5 silver
pieces a day for Rightside's exclusive services. First on their list, find an inn to stow their
belongings and get some sustenance—Bilwin is especially focused on refilling his now registered
magical beer stein.

Rightside leads them to an older establishment, off the beaten path and in a quieter part
of the city. Hanging from the second story, offset from the front door, is a sign with
a brass-colored spy glass carved into it. The barkeep rolls his eyes and gives an audible
groan as he sees the tabaxi enter behind them.

"Rightside, I thought you agreed to keep yourself away from the Spy Glass? I only just got the
place fixed up after that last group of 'clients,' as you called them!"

But, Tella, these travelers are upstanding citizens of Olam and duly-registered visitors to
our grand city! Not like those miscreants." Rightside suddenly stops speaking and looks up to
the ceiling, their eyes studying a bright fluttering reflection from one of the shiny spy glasses
decorating the inn's common room. A full 10 seconds later they look back at Tella, "That group
of ne'er-do-wells deserved what they got from the city watch and I've repaid my debt to you.
These fine folks have plenty of coin and need a safe place to respite from watchful eyes."

With a hefty sigh, Tella nods his head in agreement and offers the group some leftovers from
lunch and a round of beers. As they replenish themselves, the adventurers begin asking Rightside
about Davanor and a place called the Job Distribution Center.
