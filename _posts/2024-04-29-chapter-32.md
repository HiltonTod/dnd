THIS IS FROM CHAPTER 9, ABOUT ATTUNEMENT TO A MAGICAL WEAPON

While the group settles in for the night, Dolor sits quietly with his recently acquired
shortsword to gain [attunement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/magic-items#Attunement).
He gets the sense that it's a very old blade and probably missed by someone. After some time,
the name "Gleaming Blade" comes to his mind and he suddenly understands it's history. It was
originally wielded by a [Paladin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/paladin) in their quest
for honor and glory. While being wielded, the blade gives +1 to armor class (AC), resistance
to [Radiant Damage](https://nerdnightnews.com/radiant-damage-5e/), and for true strikes
(rolling a natural 20) it emits a radiant glow where the target must roll a constitution
saving throw or become blinded until their next turn.

I THINK THIS GOES IN THIS NEXT CHAPTER

With her gained experience and because she follows the
[Path of the Totem Warrior](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior), Gven has adopted
the Eagle's Aspect of the Beast that allows her to see 1 mile away as though it were only
100 feet. Not even having to squint, she sees heavy storm clouds blocking the light and pummeling
the sea with rains in the direction they're headed. It's unavoidable, unless they turn around
and head back to where they came from.
