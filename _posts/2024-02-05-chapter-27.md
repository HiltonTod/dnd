The bolt smashes against the chalkboard, embedding itself amidst the scribbles and
notations from Professor Verin. Everyone turns to see two cloaked figures standing by
the doorway into the classroom and four others in leather armor, slowly spreading
outward from the door. One of them is stopped a few paces from the cloaked assailants
at the door, still aiming their crossbow at the group by the chalkboard—apparently
the one who missed the professor's head by only a few inches.

Professor Verin drops to the floor as quickly as possible and hides behind the sturdy
table where the ancient map is laid out. Dolor can barely hear him mumbling, "That Tella,
this is the last time I do a favor for him. I don't care how 'interesting' the subject
matter. It's not worth losing my feathers or beak!"

Fight choreography:

<!-- Initiative rolls
  Gven - 10
  Bilwin - 7
  Grindlefoot - 16
  Mond - 3
  Dolor - 12 -->

<!-- Round 1 -->
* Grindlefoot turns quickly and throws his dagger at the mercenary holding his crossbow,
  missing his head by a few mere inches.
