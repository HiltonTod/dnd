## Backstory

On a blistering hot sunny day 23 years ago, in the grassy plains of The Badlands, a female half-orc baby entered the world unlike most others, with an uncharacteristically calm demeanor. She didn't scream or fuss or cry, rather, she quietly took in her surroundings, seeming to catalog everything of practical use. At least that's the story that Chok (chaak) and Gwendolyne Silje (gwen·doh·line sil·yuh) of the Sky Bisons tribe, Gven's (guh·ven) parents, like to tell anyone who will listen. 

While Gven Vatkem (vat·kem) has the physical size, muscle, and passion of her father's half-orc heritage, she has also learned that it's often wiser to be silent. This affords her the time and opportunity to listen, observe, analyze, and consider her options before deciding to unleash the barbarian's rage that she knows how to use so well. Her parents have helped her cultivate these skills as she's grown older and stronger, skills that are particularly uncharacteristic for half-orcs, such as herself. 

As a young adult half-orc, Chok was a traveling blacksmith of exceptional skill. He eventually settled with the Sky Bison tribe, where he was tolerated, even accepted by some, despite his orc heritage. Gwendolyne was the tribe's fiercest barbarian warrior, most astute tracker, and determined hunter. She was also a voice of reason, maturity, and leadership in the tribe, despite her young age. She was loved and respected by all members of the tribe. 

Despite his immense strength and orc heritage, Chok was intellectual and philosophical, holding to his pacifist ideals whenever possible. The world around him, judging him by his heritage, usually tried to force his hand towards violence and he discovered that seldom worked out well for him. Gwendolyne admired Chok's intelligence and thoughtful nature, leading to their deep friendship which blossomed into a deep love. 

Chok and Gwendolyne had a son, Torp, five years before Gven was born and raised their children on the outskirts of the tribe's settlement. Gwendolyne spent hours every day training her children how to fight, track, hunt, and respect the world of nature. Meanwhile, Torp and Gven spent similar time with Chok, learning how to operate a smithy and listening to his thoughts on philosophy, something shunned by most half-orcs. He wanted to prepare them for the society they would have to live in with their orc heritage on display for all to judge.  

As was usual for young adults of the tribe, Torp left the settlement around the age of 20 for his _Coming Out_, to see the world and find his path in life. It was unusual when over a year had passed and he hadn't returned for visits or sent word of his whereabouts. One year turned into two, which turned into five, and eventually became eight years since anyone from the tribe had heard from or about him. He seemed to have vanished. 

Meanwhile, Gven's introverted nature and fondness for life in the grasslands with her parents kept her at home longer than usual. And then, on her 23rd birthday, a bard traveling through the area delivered a small package to Gven. They had received it from another bard, who had received it from another, each passing along specific instructions to deliver it to Gven of the Sky Bison tribe in The Badlands. Wrapped in a small leather pouch, was a wooden amulet intricately carved with the Unwinking Eye of Gruumsh. The very amulet given to Torp by his parents when he left on his journey, to remind him of his heritage and to return safely.  

Gven knew it was time to begin her journey.
