Standing off to the side of the stone-laid street, the large half-orc throws back the hood
of his coat, seeming to invite the rain to touch his face. Even in the dark of the night and
hampered visibility of the rain, the resemblance between Gven and her brother is uncanny.
They could have been twins for the likeness in their faces. He stands three to four inches taller
than his sister and his shoulders are maybe an inch or two wider, but he's only slightly more
muscular. Both of their hair is dark and long, pulled into a single braid down their back—keeping
it out of the way during battle. The visage of acceptance on Torp's face mirrors what the
group has seen on Gven's face in moments of pensive uncertainty.

"You ask where I've been, sister. And I say, where have I not? I have journeyed far beyond
any place I could have imagined. I have discovered much. I have found purpose."

Gven is incredulous at his nebulous greeting, completely lacking in warmth for the deep sibling
bond they once shared. "It's been eight years, Torp, and not a single word. Eight years that
mother and father, not to mention myself, wondered if you were still alive. And then a bard
passing through The Badlands hands me your amulet honoring Gruumsh. Father carved that
amulet for you, as he did mine, it's our family's symbol of survival and strength. It's our
bond."

"As you can see, I have survived and I'm stronger than ever." He pauses and looks up into the
night sky, breathing deeply, feeling the rain on his face, and his mouth turns into a slight smile.
"The amulet no longer served me as it was meant to. Knowing what it means to mother and father, I
returned it to you, assuming my message was clear."

"Clear? What the fuck is clear about sending your amulet to us, without any sort of message?"
Gven shakes her head in annoyance and frustration, having finally found her brother, only to
encounter this unexpected version of him. "Okay, so you found some sort of purpose. What...what
exactly does that mean?"

At this point, Bilwin interjects "It's wonderful, this little family reunion and you two getting to
see each other again, but it's kinda wet out here. How's about we get out of this pouring rain
and grab a beer, or three?" Dolor and Mond nod in agreement, while Grindlefoot stands there
nonchalantly, completely dry in his new, very expensive and very weatherproof cloak and boots.

"But why would I want to do that?" Torp responds, once again looking up at the sky with a look
that some might call nefarious. "I so enjoy the rain."

Bilwin nods his head a few times, "okay, okay then, I think I'll wait over here." He, along
with the others, moves to the other side of the street, underneath an awning covering a door
into a shop that closed much earlier in the day.

"You ask how I've changed, to which I ask you, are we not supposed to change? Isn't that what
our Coming Out journey is all about? Are we supposed to remain the same forever, always seeing
the world through the eyes of our youth? No, our tribe embraces change, and that's what I have done.
There are small people and big people in this world, many, if not most of them are merely
trying to get by. Why is that? Why should the small cartographer's shop struggle honorably to exist
while the ignorant and lazy son of a successful merchant inherits wealth beyond what any one
family can spend? I wanted to find out why. This doesn't happen in our clan; we support each
other regardless of the situation or people."

Becoming even more frustated, Gven says "you answer questions with questions and philosophical
musings. The brother I knew was pragmatic; he disliked the dogma of narrow perspectives. Speak
plainly or not at all."

"Ever to the point, sister. Subtlety was never your strength." Torp grins, the first smile of
his that seems natural.

"I wanted to improve the world for those who deserve it and that set
me upon a journey, a very long...and strenuous journey. It took me to the open seas where our ship was
set upon by an unnatural storm and thrown against a rocky coastline. Somehow, I survived
the wreckage, the torrential downpour of rain, and drowning in the swirling currents of the water.
I woke to find myself alone on a beach. It was on that island that I found my purpose. I found faith."

Gven looks away, briefly making eye contact with Dolor. "Faith? That word is layered with
nuance, and often used in questionable ways."

"But sister, we were raised to stand up for what we believe in. What better reason is there
than faith? In ourselves, in our community," he looks at her intensely, "and in our gods.
The people of Eritz need to feel that it's okay to believe in the gods again. It's their
right to do so. It's their faith that will once again empower the gods to make our world
better, to right the wrongs we see around us. The gods will put us back on the path to
happiness and equity. Without the gods, we are doomed."

Gven takes in the monologue and begins to put together the pieces. "Ah, I see. You
discovered Amonah."

"Sister, I'm so proud of you! It _was_ you and your group that infiltrated my warehouse."

"I don't know what you're talking about, Torp. We've been looking for you, following
the leads as best we could."

"Then it is a remarkable coincidence." The muscular half-orc unconsciously stands a little
taller, naturally resorting to an intimidating stance. Unmoved, Gven holds her hands up
at her sides, ambiguously refusing to answer the threat.

With a new fire in his eyes and energy in his demeanor, Torp continues, "It's time for a
return. A return to the way things ought to have been after The Conflict.
The gods _will_ be felt again. I was given a vision during my time on Amonah and the
magic users are to blame. Because of their selfish, unchallenged desire for power, we
live in a world of inequity and suffering. The gods will fix it!"

Gven remains silent, leaving the space open for Torp to continue. The intensity seems
to drain from his eye as he says, "suffice it to say, you should leave. My love for you
is greater than you know, but it's obvious that you aren't ready to join me. Yet. But you're
drawing unwanted attention to the work we're doing. I'm here to bring the gods back to
Elsemar. Once their rule is established in the city, they'll launch their campaign to
reclaim the whole of Eritz."

"At what cost, Torp?"

"At any cost. Whatever is necessary. Perhaps you need to travel more, to see more of the
world. It's filled with villainy, hardship, tragedy, loss, and greed. We must be rid
of magic and its practitioners if we're to make the world a better place. If you were
to experience what I did on that island, perhaps you could understand. Regardless, you
must leave Elsemar...or I'll be forced to deal with you." He finally looks at the others
standing across the narrow street, "and your friends, in a permanent manner."

Looking downward with resignation, Gven says "I can't support you in this...endeavor. But,
I will try to understand it." Her companions look slightly alarmed at her subdued
response, although Dolor appears less surprised and more contemplative.

"I appreciate that, Gven. You will always be dear to me. That's why I came to meet you
in person to ask you to leave my affairs alone."

"Are you asking me as Torp...or Davanor?"

With a sense of finality and looking directly into her eyes, "they are the same." Torp
suddenly shifts into a casual stance and his presence becomes less intimidating. "When
you return home, please tell mother and father that I'm fine. You are all dear to me and
I don't want any of you to come to harm." As he turns to leave, he punches her softly on
the shoulder, as the younger siblings used to do. "Be safe, sister."

As Davanor walks off into the dark and rainy night, Grindlefoot strolls over to Gven
with a sad demeanor. "I hate to say it, but your brother is a zealot. Let's get back to
the ship and some much needed rest. You need time to take this in before we discuss what's
next."

Long rest....

<!-- The following summary was temporarily written up, giving me time to fully vet
  the conversation between Gven and Torp. -->
  
<details><summary>Synopsis:</summary>

<ul>
  <li>Gven reconnects with her older brother, Torp, and discovers that he has become a zealot
    for one (or more?) of the old gods. He was lost at sea, saved by the gods, and brought
    to the island of Amonah. There he was taught (indoctrinated) that magic users are the
    ones who caused The Conflict, they alone are to blame.</li>
  <li>Torp returned to Elsemar using the disguise of Davanor, a Damian, with the goal of
    genocide—to completely eradicate magic users from Eritz.</li>
  <li>Davanor warns Gven and the others to leave Elsemar now, if they want to live.</li>
  <li>Gven and the others return to the Iron Vulture, where they realize that Cap'n Don is
    an <a href="http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/artificer">artificer</a> as he turns the ship into
    a faraday cage to protect them during the night.</li>
</ul>

Long rest....

<ul>
  <li>They go to the Broken Spy Glass to consult with Tella. Talk and stuff....</li>
  <ul>
    <li>In the old tongue, "Davanor" has special meaning: "davan" is "to pray" and "or" is "to light."
      Torp took on the name as a symbol for his prayers bringing light to the world.</li>
    <li>Elsemar was the seat of the clerical power in Eritz and Mirganor was the seat of arcane power.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The group decides to set sail for the old, unknown island of Amonah and investigate
    where Torp learned about the gods and turned into a zealot.</li>
  <li>They tell the harbor master that the ship is headed to the Northlands to trade, as a way
    of throwing Davanor off their trail.</li>
  <li>Tella will give them supplies for their journey.</li>
  <li>They realized that they were viewing the holy symbol upside down. Turned 180 degrees,
    Bilwin recognized it as the symbol for B'raq (similar to
    <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Talos">Talos</a>?)
