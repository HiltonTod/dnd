Leaving the small pirate's cove behind them, Dolor leads the way into the jungle swinging a
machete to open up the narrow path. Bilwin follows closely behind, still savoring the flavor of
Boscoe's brew—with which he has conveniently filled his magical stein. Mond is entranced
by their surroundings, captivated by the plethora of sights and sounds vying for his attention.
As a [Circle of the Land druid](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/515-druid-101-circle-of-the-land),
Grindlefoot barely even notices the path, moving deftly through the thick vegetation as though
it were an open field of pleasant flowers. Bringing up the rear, Gven keeps one hand on Tempest
Edge's hilt and the other catching the thin branches and vines that attack her face, snapping
back into their regular position after kindly making way for Grindlefoot passing in front of her.

The dense jungle vegetation encroaches on the barely visible trail that winds northward towards
their destination, the mountainside temple. The sunlight drips through the thick canopy of leaves
and branches over their heads, casting more shadows than light. Lush ferns and lengthly vines
choke the undergrowth, completely covering the path at various points. The air is thick with
the smells of sweet berries—that they dare not eat—and the damp earth below their feet. Screeches
and bellows fill the air, a wild chorus of animals they can only imagine because they're
camouflaged by the surrounding plants.

After a few hours of slowly moving northward, Dolor catches a scent in the air and Bilwin
recognizes it as fresh blood. Moving cautiously, the tiefling and dwarf enter a small space
where the ground cover and plants are trampled. They see a large animal's bloody carcasse
lying there, obviously having been very recently killed. Mond walks into the area just as
they hear rustling in the bushes and a very large lizard comes crashing in. The twenty-foot tall
[tyrannosaurus rex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17041-tyrannosaurus-rex) sees the
adventurers and gives a tremendous roar, staking its claim to the prey before them. 

## Fight choreography

<!-- Initiative rolls:
  Bilwin - 10
  Dolor - 6
  Grindlefoot - 6
  Gven - 13
  Mond - 18
-->

<!-- Round 1 -->
* Mond - Casts his signature pink [Lightning Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2167-lightning-bolt)
  at the creature, causing 30 damage.
* T-rex - Bites Mond for 41 piercing damage, then swings its tail at Bilwin for 18 bludgeoning damage.
  * Bilwin attempts to harness his [luck](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/feat:lucky), but fails to prevent the damage.
* Gven - Enables her [Barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/)
  while advancing from the edge of the clearing. She swings Tempest Edge at the giant reptile, connecting
  on her first swing but unable to pierce the skin, and then causing 16 damage with her backswing.
* Bilwin - Calls for help from [Hanseath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hanseath) and
  [Blesses](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2016-bless) everyone (1d4 to any attack or save).
* Dolor - Moves closer to Gven (to gain advantage on melee attacks while she's raging) and attacks
  with Gleaming Blade for 11 piercing damage.
* Grindlefoot - Casts [Conjure Animals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2039-conjure-animals) and
  the group hears thundering hoofbeats approaching them through the jungle.

<!-- Round 2 -->
* Mond - Casts another pink [Lightning Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2167-lightning-bolt)
  at the creature for 29 damage.
  * He quickly swigs a healing potion, regaining 8 health.
* T-rex - Bites the last one to attack it, Dolor, for 19 damage.
  * Dolor reacts with [Hellish Rebuke](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hellish-rebuke) for 16 damage to the T-rex.
  * Lashes its tail at Gven, causing 10 bludgeoning damage.
* Gven - Swings Tempest Edge with a fury, connecting twice for 9 and 15 in damage.
* Suddenly a humongous pink rhinocerous emerges from the jungle, running straight at the reptile and rams it
  with its horn, knocking the T-rex prone and killing it. With a huff of breath, the rhino continues off
  into the jungle beyond the clearing, charging ahead and leaving a trail of glittery dust behind it.

Grindlefoot quickly decides to have the magical rhinocerous run towards the mountain temple, breaking
a trail for the group. They follow the trail, getting occasional glimpses of the pink rhino and its
voluminous puffs of gilttery farts. After an hour, the magical animal disappears and they reach
the end of its trail shortly afterwards.

Being close to night time, they decide to look for a safe place to make camp. Because Grindlefoot
is an [Outlander](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/background:outlander) druid, he uses his
[Wanderer](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/background:outlander#toc2) skills to find a small glade
with fresh water and room enough for them to rest. Not wanting to share their bedrolls with the
insects and other small animals on the ground, they decide to rig hammocks by hanging their
tents from the trees.

During the third watch, Dolor hears a 'fooomp' from the brush. It happens again, 'fooomp', and
then again, 'fooomp', when suddenly several tiny blue luminescent humanoid creatures appear.
There must be a dozen of them, at
least that he can see, no taller than the length of his hands. They're curious, poking around
the backpacks, silently taking stock of what they can see, but not absconding with anything.
One appears to be particularly enamored with Gven's Tempest Edge, still in it's scabbard and
laying next to Gven, whose hand rests on the hilt. The small creature slides it out a little
bit, just enough so that they can see the glimmering blue blade and a look of awe crosses its
face before it slides the sword back into place.

One of them scurries up towards Dolor, only a few feet away from him, where he can see that their
bodies are covered in tiny little geometric designs, similar to tattoos. Looking at the tiny
fae creature, he attempts to communicate in several languages but doesn't receive any responses.
He offers the small being a tiny morsel from his rations, but it's ignored. They merely stare
at Dolor with a look of mild interest. About ten to fifteen minutes after they appeared and began
curiously investigating, they just as suddenly decide to leave. The last remaining fae is the
one that Dolor attempted to communicate with and they give a slight nod of their head before
quickly disappearing into the jungle vegetation.

"Well, I wonder what that was all about?"

Long rest....
