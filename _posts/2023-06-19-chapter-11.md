The group of adventurers are standing in the treeline with Elar and Vera, just below the
open area leading up to the hill giant's domain. They can still just make out the large
beast swatting around in the tall mountain grass looking for the giant goat that mysteriously
disappeared.

While Elar is turned away, captivated by his daughter in the moment of their reunion,
Grindlefoot conjures some [goodberries](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/goodberry) for
the two recently rescued captives. They're both gaunt from lack of food and tired from
the stress, and the goodberries provide a visible benefit to their overall being in that
moment.

Knowing that they all need some rest after the encounter, the group heads back to Lyra's
grove. After a few hours of hiking, careful to leave as little of a trail as possible, they
reach their destination. They thoughtfully push their way through the blackberry bushes
that provide natural camouflage—and juicy snacks. Grindlefoot asks Elar and Vera to collect
some small firewood, allowing him to start a fire with his magic and not create an
uncomfortable situation. They spend the afternoon and evening in Lyra's grove, quietly
chatting and, mostly, allowing Elar and Vera to enjoy their reunion.

Long rest....

They wake the next morning, refreshed and eager to return to Wayside. Before leaving,
Xantic creates a talking stone for Lyra and leaves it in the grove with a message conveying
their thanks, along with a warning of the other goblin tribe that Vera mentioned regularly
visits the hill giant. Dolor leads them to Wayside, without any interruptions, and they
arrive mid-afternoon.

The townsfolk are surprised to see Elar and Vera, especially Preva, who is astounded and
overjoyed at the return of her family. Bonnie and Trill offer free drinks to the town's
new heroes and everyone slowly makes their way to the Buzzin Bee's common room.

Throughout the day, the news of Elar and Vera's safe return spreads around town, out to
the surrounding farms, and even those who usually keep to themselves gather in and
around the Buzzin Bee to celebrate the news—and heroes.
