The morning light arrives to find the group already awake and eager to continue their journey
to the mountain temple. Dolor leads the group, with Bilwin close behind him, then Mond,
Grindlefoot, and Gven bringing up the tail end. They battle the jungle's dense foliage and
thick vegetation for several hours, making slow progress towards their destination.

They enter a small area that has slightly less vegetation than the path they've tread. It's
not large enough to be considered a glade or even a clearing, but it's noticeable. As Dolor
enters the area, he sees several bunches of
[large yellow flowers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Yellow_musk_creeper), blossoming
from vines that are encircling the trees. He catches a whiff of their fragrances, immediately 
thinking to himself how pretty they are and that he wants to see them up closer. With a shake
of his head, his mind clears of the odd desire to smell the flowers and he continues forward.

Bilwin, Mond, and Grindlefoot also observe the lovely flowers, feel a sudden desire to
smell them up close, and then decide to continue ahead. Meanwhile, Gven is the last one to
encounter them and becomes enthralled with experiencing their beauty and holding them in her
hands. When she nears the closest one, the six flowering vines close in on the group,
surrounding them and preventing any escape.

-->

The route in front of him suddenly closes off; Dolor immediately draws Gleaming
Blade in one hand and his shortsword in the other. He attacks one of the slithering vines,
cutting off several blooming flowers and tendrils.

Responding to the assault, Mond casts [Ray of Frost](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2226-ray-of-frost)
at a vine close to him. The streaks of blue-white light crackle and vibrate through the air,
turning many of the plant's stems and leaves to brittle ice.

Meanwhile, Gven approaches the vine closest to her, about to touch it, when she's
suddenly able to shake off the enchantment and backs away. Grindlefoot turns back towards
Gven and casts [Flame Blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2106-flame-blade), quickly
slicing through many of its appendages and flowers.

Bilwin wasn't really paying that close of attention as they were walking, mostly putting
one foot in front of the other and making sure Dolor's backside was always there. He
sees Dolor draw his swords and then realizes the flowers are moving, and not in a very
amicable way. He swings his [hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy) from
his back and smashes one of the vines with it, obviously causing a bit of pain, because the
vine flinched. He then casts [Spiritual Weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon)
and his usual spectral companion in battle, a glowing beer stein, appears floating next to him.
The aggressive mug attacks the same vine and pushes it back more, causing some damage, but not
enough to get rid of it.

The hostile plants continue to attack the group, this time with their psychic abilities.
Gven and Bilwin appear to be the most impacted, each of them momentarily holding their
heads and closing their eyes in agony. Emitting an odor, one of the vines is able to
enchant Gven again, who suddenly wants nothing more than to cradle the pretty flowers in
her hands.

<!-- Round 2 -->

<!-- Step-by-step
* Dolor - Attacks the vine in front of him with Gleaming Blade for 25 damage.
  * Off-hand attack with his shortsword connects for 6 damage.
* Mond - Casts [Fire Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2103-fire-bolt)
  at a vine close to him, causing 18 damage.
* Gven - Approaches the vine closest to her, about to touch it, but is able to
  shake off the enchantment.
* Grindlefoot - Attacks with his [Flame Blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2106-flame-blade),
  causing 10 damage and also punches the vine with his other hand, for 3 damage.
* Nix Whisperfang (Chris Sells) - Bursts out of the jungle into their midst, his
  scimitar bursts into flame, and he screams "Kazah!" as he slashes at the vine 5
  twice, causing it 19 and 20 damage.
  * A male [tabaxi](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Tabaxi_(5e_Race_Variant)) who is
    large and muscular, covered in scars that interrupt his fur line, wearing scale
    mail, and carrying a scimitar. 
* Bilwin - Casts [Guiding Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2133-guiding-bolt)
  at vine 3 for 21 damage and the spiritual weapon attacks vine 3, causing 18 damage.
  * Vine 3 is killed.
* Vine 6 - Attacks Gven and misses.
* Vine 2 - Attacks Bilwin for 17 psychic damage.
  * Nix reacts and casts a blood curse at the vine, that subtracts 4 1d6 from damage to Bilwin.
* Vine 4 - Attacks Dolor for 6 psychic damage.
* Vine 1 - Attacks Dolor and misses.
  * Dolor reacts with [Hellish Rebuke](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hellish-rebuke) for 7 fire damage.
* Vine 5 - Attacks Grindlefoot and misses.
 -->

Again, Dolor swings Gleaming Blade at the vine in front of him, following it with
his off-hand sword, both causing a significant amount of damage. Standing in the middle of
the group, Mond directs [Fire Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2103-fire-bolt) at a vine
close to him, the mote of fire incinerating large parts of it.

Enchanted, Gven approaches the vine closest to her but is able to shake off the unwanted
desire to touch it. Standing next to Gven, Grindlefoot attacks with his
[Flame Blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2106-flame-blade), slicing through a
piece of the vine and setting fire to a few flowers. He follows up with a frustrated
punch, "stop enchanting my friend, you slithering ninny!"

Suddenly, a large ball of fur carrying a flaming scimitar explodes from the large jungle into
their midst. Screaming "Kazah!", their new ally attacks the vines with a vengeance and fury,
tearing it into pieces, although it's still alive and moving about.

Bilwin is momentarily transfixed by this tall, muscular
[tabaxi](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Tabaxi_(5e_Race_Variant)) who has unexpectedly
come to their aid. It's covered in scars that interrupt its fur lines, wearing
scale mail, and carring a lengthy scmitar that is covered in magical flames.
Blinking his eyes a few times to make sure it's real, Bilwin realizes that they're still
in the midst of battle. He casts [Guiding Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2133-guiding-bolt)
at a vine and his spiritual weapon attacks the same one with its force spell. He can
see the vine and its flowers shrivel up into death.

Two of the vines attempt to charm Gven and Dolor, but the half-orc and tiefling are able
to resist the magical compulsion. Dolor reacts with
[Hellish Rebuke](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hellish-rebuke), inflicting a fiery
consequence on the plant. Two other vines attack Bilwin and Dolor with their psychic
assaults, forcing them to stop fighting momentarily and deal with the pain. 
Nix reacts and casts a [blood curse](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/blood-hunter:blood-curse) at
one of the vines, reducing the damage to Bilwin. The fifth vine attempts to enchant Grindlefoot
and fails.

<!-- Round 3 -->

<!-- Step-by-step -->
* Dolor - Attacks the vine in front of him with Gleaming Blade for 23 damage.
  * Off-hand attack with his shortsword connects for 6 damage.
  * Vine 1 is killed.
* Mond - Casts [Lightning Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2167-lightning-bolt)
  at vine 2, causing 28 damage.
* Gven - Attacks vine 6 with Tempest Edge twice, for 11 and 15 slashing damage.
* Grindlefoot - Attacks with his [Flame Blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2106-flame-blade),
  causing 13 damage and also punches the vine with his other hand, for 3 damage.
* Nix Whisperfang (Chris Sells) - Attacks vine 4 with his flaming scimitar twice, for 18 and 15 damage.
  * Vine 4 is killed.
* Bilwin - Attacks vine 2 with his hurdy-gurdy and connects for 7 damage, even though he
  slipped and fell as he swung the instrument. 
  * Spiritual weapon imitates Bilwin's slip, but with more grace, and attacks vine 2 for 9 damage.
* Vine 6 - Spews the granular substance from its flowers at the group, enchanting Dolor and Gven.
* Vine 2 - Attacks Dolor and misses.
* Vine 5 - Attacks Grindlefoot for 8 psychic damage.
* Vines 1, 3, and 4 are dead

<!-- Round 4 -->

<!-- Step-by-step -->
* Dolor - Shakes off the enchantment.
* Mond - Casts [Lightning Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2167-lightning-bolt)
  at vines 5 and 6, causing 32 damage each.
  * Vine 5 is killed.
* Gven - Shakes off the enchantment.
* Grindlefoot - Attacks vine 6 with his [Flame Blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2106-flame-blade),
  causing 16 damage and killing it.
  * Vine 6 is killed.
* Nix Whisperfang (Chris Sells) - Pushes past Dolor, who is eagerly approaching the last
  living vine, steps over Bilwin, who is enthralled by this heroic tabaxi in their midst,
  and attacks the last vine with his scimitar, for 22 and 23 damage.
  * Vine 2 is killed.

After killing the last vine, the large tabaxi turns to the group and says, "I suppose
introductions are in order. I'm Nix Whisperfang and, well, this is what I do. These damned
[musk creepers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Yellow_musk_creeper) turn their
victims into zombies that serve them. They're all over this island and nearly impossible
to spot before you're in range of their psychic attacks or being charmed by the puffs of
purple pollin. I've been tracking a particularly large lizard zombie. Have y'all seen it?"

Just then, before anyone can respond to Nix, they hear a thunderous roar and the ground
beneath their feet begins to shake. Bilwin turns to Grindlefoot, "Please tell me that you
decided to summon that helpful pink rhinocerous again."
Grindlefoot looks up into the air thoughtfully.

Watching in the direction where the roar came from, the group can see the tops of the trees
moving and shaking, as though something very large is pushing them aside. In a matter of
moments, the creature comes into view and they can see it's a much larger version of the
reptile they encountered a few days ago, except that it's undead.

Stopping twenty feet from them, they can see that the [tyrannosaurus rex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17041-tyrannosaurus-rex)
has rotting skin that only covers some of its bones and body, the eyes are sunken, with one eyeball
hanging slightly out of its socket, and yet the claws seem as sharp as any well-honed blade.
Standing still, it begins to kvetch and make a retching sound while extending its snout,
three humanoid zombies tumble out of its mouth.
