    of Ben's many fields in the area. After this conquest, the group began calling
    themselves Chimera's Bane.
*   **Great Mouth** [The Great Mouth] - A hill giant who lives in the lower part of

## Objects

*   **Gleaming Blade** - Dolor's shortsword, acquired during their encounter with the goblins
    who were holding Elar prisoner in caves outside of Wayside. It was originally wielded by a
    Paladin in their quest for honor and glory. While being wielded, the blade gives +1 to armor
    class (AC), resistance to Radiant Damage, and for true strikes (rolling a natural 20) it
    emits a radiant glow where the target must roll a constitution saving throw or become blinded
    until their next turn.
