# TEMPORARY SUMMARY OF EVENTS

<!-- Directions on a boat:
  Port = left side
  Starboard = right side
  Bow = front
  Stern = back -->

## Morning

* Cap'n Don takes the Iron Vulture and the adventurers out to sea to find Amonah.
  * With a wink of his eye, the captain tells the harbor master that they're headed to the Northlands.
  * Only two rules on the boat:
    1. Don't fall off
    2. Do what Cap'n Don asks
* Grindlefoot casts [Water Breathing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/water-breathing) on everyone,
  just in case _something_ happens.
* As they're sailing:
  * Gven and Bilwin try to entertain the others with their flute and hurdy-gurdy, but they both need
    some more pratctice.
  * Mond is keenly interested in how the unique vessel works and asks Cap'n Don to show him the ropes.
  * Grindlefoot can't quite get his sea legs underneath him and spends a lot of time at the stern of the
    ship, feeling queasy and emptying his stomach into the salt water below.
  * Dolor quietly observes everything going on around them, taking in how things work in his own way
    and deciding where he can be the most help.
* Bilwin brings out the old map that he bought from the cartographer in Elsemar, Whichway.
  * According to Cap'n Don, the islands they're headed towards are called the Pierced Vale.
  * After The Conflict, those who refused to give up their religious faith left Eritz and fled to
    those islands.
  * Cap'n Don has sailed around the area before and always encountered weird tides and currents, but
    he's never set foot on any of the individual islands.

## Afternoon

* In between vomiting off the stern, Grindlefoot notices a large dark spot in the water that is
  following the ship for several minutes. It disappears for a few moments, then suddenly two large
  tentacles erupt from the water and over the port side of the ship. Gven immediately runs over to
  them, ready for battle.

Fight choreography:

<!-- Initiative rolls:
  Bilwin - 21 (nat 20)
  Gven - 10
  Mond - 13
  Dolor - 16
  Grindlefoot - 18 -->

<!-- Round 1 -->
* Tentacle 1 smashes Gven for 16 bludgeoning damage.
* Tentacle 2 crashes the side of the ship, but doesnt' hurt it much because of its heavy metal reinforcement.
* Bilwin awards Gven with Inspiration [add 1d6 to any role to hit] and then is too surprised to do anything else.
* Grindlefoot casts [Call Lightning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/call-lightning) at the body of the creature,
  that's still underwater, but it doesn't have any effect on it.
* Dolor attacks with Gleaming Blade for 18 damage on the tentacle holding Gven, but it merely bounces off
  the thick skin.
* Mond casts [Mind Spike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mind-spike) and causes 13 damage, visibly harming it.
* Gven invokes her [barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/)
  and is able to grapple free of the tentacle's grip.
