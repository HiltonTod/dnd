# Things

## Plants

*   **Hero's Wort** - A plant created and farmed by Ben in the countryside around Wayside. It has
    a stalk similar to corn and large tobacco-like leaves that drape over themselves. When inhaled
    the recipient gains +3 to proficiencies for 1 round, not including attacks.
    [[ch. 4](/dnd/campaign/chapter-4/)]

## Objects

*   **Gleaming Blade** - Dolor's shortsword, acquired during their encounter with the goblins
    who were holding Elar prisoner in caves outside of Wayside [see [ch. 9](/dnd/campaign/chapter-9/)].
    It was originally wielded by a Paladin in their quest for honor and glory. While being wielded,
    the blade gives +1 to armor class (AC), resistance to Radiant Damage, and for true strikes
    (rolling a natural 20) it emits a radiant glow where the target must roll a constitution saving
    throw or become blinded until their next turn.
