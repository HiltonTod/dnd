After wrapping up with the city guard at Waffle Wizards, the group walks over
to Dolly's Donuts to give them the news. Dolly and her crew are happy to have
things get back to normal and Fred, the chef, reveals his latest baked creation.
"I call this a lunch donut." He lays a tray on the table that is full of round
pastries with holes in the middle, but the bread looks different, it glistens as
though it's been polished. Grindlefoot grabs one from the tray and seems to enjoy
the flavor. "The outside is crisp, like a crust, and the inside is much
thicker than a usual donut. Tasty! I think some sort of creamy spread would pair
well with these."

It's now mid-afternoon and the group heads back to the Broken Spy Glass. When they
arrive, they debrief with Tella and discover that Rightside has been following them.
A testament to his skills that they didn't notice. They lay low for the rest of
the afternoon, the previous night and this morning were eventful, to say the least.

They reconvene in the common room for dinner to find it bustling with a wide variety
of customers. Some are obviously well off, although not so much so that they don't
still prefer a good deal over flaunting their perogative. Many of them appear to be
laborers, enjoying a dinner and drink out with friends and some entertainment.
It's a calm, yet joyful and happy crowd.

After dinner, Gven tells the others, "I'm going for a stroll. Might head over to the
Job Distribution Center and have a casual look around. Looking for opportunities,
not trouble." Bilwin is eyeballing the stage, sizing up the lute player and says,
"I'm going to stay here. These fine folk deserve some real entertainment and I'm
just the lean, handsome, well-dressed dwarf to give it to them!" Mond, Dolor, and
Grindlefoot agree to walk with Gven.

Leaving the Broken Spy Glass, they pass through the marketplace. Just as busy as it
was during the daytime, it's transformed into a cornucopia of festive delights.
There's a celebratory feeling with lights strung overhead, draping across the
booths and aisles, and people laughing with their friends over the day's events.
There are still plenty of ways to spend your hard-earned coin, although the
purchases might bring a little more immediate pleasure than the items sold during
the day.

It's not long before they pass into the Sliver, which is quieter than the market,
but still bustling with people. Most seem to be headed in the same direction as
the adventurers. As the group nears the JDC, Grindlefoot subtly casts
[Pass without Trace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pass-without-trace) to help
conceal them from anyone who might be looking too closely.
