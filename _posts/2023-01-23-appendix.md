    the blade gives +1 to armor class (AC), resistance to Radiant Damage, and for true strikes

    throw or become blinded until their next turn.

    *   _Effect:_ When consumed, the drinker gains temporary hit points equal to 3d8 + their Constitution
        modifier. Additionally, for the next minute, the drinker emits a bright light in a 10-foot radius
        and dim light for an additional 10 feet. Any hostile creature that starts its turn within 5 feet
        of the drinker takes 1d4 radiant damage as the radiant energy emanates from their presence.

## Plants
