## Approaching Elsemar

It's early afternoon, several hours before dusk will begin to takeover the day, as the adventurers
approach the Pride of the Coast, Elsemar. Before reaching the gates, they pass through the Shade,
a seeming overflow of people, homes, and businesses from the city proper, that sidles right up to the
city walls. After 15 minutes of walking, they reach the gates, open during peace time yet guarded
by the city watch, dressed in the city's deep purple and bright silver livery.

About twenty feet in front of the main gate is an arch across the last stretch of The Ha-derech.
The group stops at a building a short distance from the arch and see that all of the travelers are
walking through it. A guard standing in the center of the road, between the arch and the gate, trains
a sharp eye on each visitor as they pass through. Every once in awhile, they direct a traveler off
to the side of the road for questioning or tell them to register with the Hall of Records.

## Getting past the guards

As the adventurers proceed through the archway, the guard stops them for questioning. Within a few
minutes, they direct Dolor and Bilwin to register their magical items: Dolor's sword, Gleaming Blade,
and Bilwin's ever-filled beer stein. The guard turns to Mond and asks if he's already registered in
the city or has papers to enter. Admitting that he has neither, Mond is ordered to go directly to
the Hall of Records and register. If he doesn't comply, the city guard will have to take _precautionary
measures_, as the guard points to others along the wall with arrows knocked and pointed at Mond.

The group proceeds through the Scrivener's Burrough, immediately beyond the gate and the Pride and
Comfort's stables, to register Mond.
