Returning to Hallix Mausoleum, the group enters the crypts, pass through the first room into the
second and turn right, carefully traversing the caved-in tunnel to the room where they finished
off the [wights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17059-wight). On the north wall, there are two
more doors for them to investigate, one to each side of the room where they discovered Sarcelle
Malinosh. At the west wall, a short set of stairs leads up to a landing and the closed door with a
large painted eye. In the southern wall, another caved-in tunnel leads into darkness, next to a
pile of stone rubble in the southeastern corner.

"Shall we see what lies in these other doors, next to the sorceress's prison cell?" Dolor opens
the unlocked door and moves forward cautiously. It seems to be a storage room, filled with all sorts
of supplies. Crates, boxes, and large bags are stacked against one of the walls. On two other walls
are shelves containing lanterns, dry food stuff, casks of water, manacles, chains, and more.

Two flasks catch the tiefling's eye and upon closer inspection, they both have "take to feel better"
scrawled across their fronts. Suspicious of their surroundings, Gven suggests Bilwin verify
they're healing potions and not something nefarious. Accepting the flask from Dolor, the cleric
removes the stopper, takes a sniff and casts [Detect Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619097-detect-magic).

"Oh no, these aren't going to help anyone who drinks them. Quite the opposite, really." He moves
to put them back on the shelf, but Gven suggests they might come in handy sometime.

"Indeed, they might." And he puts them into a special pocket within his
[Bag of Holding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4581-bag-of-holding).
