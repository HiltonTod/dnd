Walking westward, Bilwin and Blauer Mond have been traveling together for a few days, not
necessarily out of friendship. Rather, out of convenience, direction, and safety in numbers,
as so many travelers find themselves doing in these times of uncertainty. The two couldn't
be much more different, at least to the average passerby or observant. 

Bilwin, is a garishly dressed male [dwarf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/13-dwarf), carrying
a [hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy) across his back, and a mouth
that doesn't seem to ever stop talking. Meanwhile, Mond is a male [half-elf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/20-half-elf),
wearing non-descript traveling clothes and a light crossbow slung over his shoulder. Mond
seems to be ignoring Bilwin's constant prattling, until it stops and the sudden silence
reveals the sound of battle coming from the village up ahead. Apparently, Bilwin—self-titled
"the Magnificent," as he likes to remind everyone—is much more aware of his surroundings than
his constant chatter belies.

"Hold a minute, my hushed Half-Elven friend. Do you hear that? The sounds of battle are faint, but
coming from that village we near. Dare we continue our approach?" With a nod of his head
and a short step forward, Mond gives his answer. "So we shall, my brave companion. So we shall!"
As the two travelers enter the edge of the village, they hear a large roar, followed shortly by
an undecipherable battle cry, and then silence.
