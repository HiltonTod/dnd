Having defeated the animated pastries, Fred, the half-orc pastry chef at Dolly's Donuts, 
says in his slow, dry voice, "do or donut, there is no try."

More curious than before, Dolor and Mond continue to ask questions of Dolly and Fred. They
soon discover that the animated donuts were made with fresh flour delivered this morning
from Grinder's Mill. A quick check by Mond determines that it's enchanted. Dolor suggests
taking a sample of the magicked flour as evidence and Dolly gives them a full bag. 

On their way into the donut shop, Bilwin had noticed an interesting sign for Eclairvoyant's
Tea Shop placed on the front window. Dolly described Claire as a bit strange, but no moreso
than many of the other small shop owners in Food Alley. As the group is leaving Dolly's,
Bilwin and Grindlefoot ask Fred for some donuts to go, assuming they're made from non-magical
flour. In his drawling speech, Fred says, "well, they're not nearly as good as fresh ones and
I don't like folks to think of my creations that way, but okay, I suppose that's all we
have at the moment."

Entering Eclairvoyant's Tea Shop, they're greeted by Claire and a mid-sized room lovingly
curated with fine-looking éclairs, eccentric tea flavors, and eclectic furnishings with
an overwhelming smell of burning incense—that makes everyone cough just a little as they
pass through the front door.

"Welcome to Eclairvoyant's Tea Shop, where we guide you to your destiny while delighting
your tastebuds and olfactories!" Bilwin immediately responds with, "this doesn't look like
an old factory. Where are all the machines and dirty tables? Do they want me to work? I'll
work for beer, but it better be the good stuff."

When the introductions are complete, Claire agrees to answer their questions only if they
purchase private readings, for 1 gold piece each, mind you. Once their readings are complete,
she reveals that there have been some odd occurrences lately, magical things that she
cannot explain. For example, the door will unexpectedly begin talking to customers as they
enter the shop, telling them how bad the tea is or that the prophecies are lies.
Bilwin asks to see the flour they've used for their pastries and Mond
confirms that it's enchanted, like Dolly's Donuts. Claire confirms that they also use
Grinder's Mill, because they're local, have fair prices, and he's kind of nice,
especially for a dwarf.

The adventurers give their thanks and decide to head to Grinder's Mill next. On their way
out of the tea shop, Mond notices an odd marking on the door. A sigil that's sort of faded away—or
someone purposely tried to remove it—that is commonly used for the spell, 
[Magic Mouth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-mouth). He notices another faded mark
scratched into the wood door that resembles two letter W's together, WW.

On their way to Grinder's Mill, Bilwin sees a sign for The Fizz Hutt and immediately becomes
entranced with kombucha. What is this fermented drink he's never heard of?

Entering The Fizz Hutt, they're greeted by a small gnome standing behind the counter,
although only his eyes and forehead are visible. "Welcome, friends! I be Thistlewick
Brandlestrum and this," he spreads his arms wide indicating the shop, "be the Fizz Hutt,
your favorite destination for all things kombucha!" Bilwin responds, "Hello, my
small-statured deliverer of new experiences! I've never heard of this thing,
come-booo-chah. Can you tell me about it?" A look of amazement crosses Thistlewick's face
as he jumps up on a stool so they can now see his upper body and takes on the pose of
a great orator.

Bilwin and Dolor taste some of the uniquely named varieties of kombucha, enjoying them. Dolor
asks Thistlewick if he's experienced any odd magical-type things occurring in his shop and he
replies that he hasn't. After finishing the caffeine-filled kombucha, Bilwin is even more
frenetic than usual and Dolor has to guide him out of the shop, onwards to Grinder's Mill.

Arriving at the mill, they see that the large brick structure is surrounded by green towers,
presumably filled with raw grain for milling. Their journey has brought them closer to the docks,
although still relatively close to Food Alley. That makes sense, the mill likely receives
grain and ships out flour via the port. Entering the hulking structure, the group sees
a sign just inside the door, "Warning - extinguish ALL flames!" A dwarf greets them and
they ask to talk with the owner. 

"Boss! There's folks here at want ta see ya."

A large, burly, muscular dwarf with blond hair comes out from behind some machinery. He's
wearing an apron and it's difficult to distinguish if the original color was off-white,
cream, or pure white. "Ok, Rezko. I'm here, now back to work with ya." The first dwarf 
quickly moves over to a piece of machinery and begins pulling levers.

"What ya want?"

Dolor, being the defacto ambassador for the group, says, "We've discovered some concerning
things happening in Food Alley and we think it might be your flour."

The broad shouldered dwarf squints his eyes and takes half a step closer to Dolor, "you
sayin my flour's bad?"

"Not at all, friend. We're looking into a matter for some of the shops that involves
unwanted magic-type things going on. This bag of flour that Dolly received just this morning
is enchanted." He points at Gven, who is holding the bag with Grinder's logo stamped on it.
"Same for Eclairvoyant's morning delivery. We're hoping you might know
something about it. And I presume you're Grinder?"

He takes a step back and seems to calm down a touch, "that's the name on the building,
ain't it. Rezko! How'd the deliveries go this morning?"

"Well, boss, made 'em all on time, like you want. No muss, no fuss." The smaller, yet still
considerably muscular Rezko pauses for a moment and looks off into the distance. "Come
to think of it, boss, there was this juggling goblin in front of Waffle Wizards. He was
a might good at it, but that didn't last long and he was done. Actually, he dropped
the last skillet he was juggling and had to get it out from under the wagon. That was it.
I swear boss, all the deliveries were on time!"

"There ya go, no trouble." As though the subject's resolved, Grinder turns to walk away
and get back to work.

Mond says "Waffle Wizards, eh. That etching on Eclairvoyant's door sure looked like two
letter W's. Coincidence? It wouldn't take but a few seconds for a wizard to cast a spell
on the flour in that wagon. With everyone distracted and his hands out of sight while
under the wagon, piece of cake. Grinder, have you had any problems with Waffle Wizards?"

Grinder stops and turns back to the group, "Nope. They pay on time and that's what matters
to me."

"What about the manager or the workers? Have you heard anything?"

His patience is obviously wearing thin, but he answers Mond, "The place has been there
for a long time now, but the manager is new. Goes by K'ren. She kept chewing my ear off
a few weeks ago about all the new upstart shops in the Alley. Sayin they shouldn't be
allowed to open, stealin customers from the places atta already there."

The adventurers decide that Waffle Wizards is their next stop and thank Grinder for
his help.

"Yep. Now, donut go causing too much a ruckus out there."
