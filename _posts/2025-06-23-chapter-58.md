Looking around the room to see they're alone, Dolor eyes the robed corpses and investigates them
for anything of value or perhaps useful information. "Hand me that bloody cloth, will you?" Mond
pulls it from his [Bag of Holding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4581-bag-of-holding) and
takes it to the tiefling, who compares it to a tear in the bottom of an figure's robes. "Good boy,
Grindlefoot! You found the owner."

Moving to the leader's corpse, Dolor shares his discovery with the others. "This tattoo of a staring
eye on the back of their hand matches the painting on the door in the other room. They take this
seriously, like most zealots I suppose."

The room has three more doors they haven't explored yet, one on each wall, north, south, and west.
Figuring that they should start somewhere, Gven decides to investigate the door on the north wall.
She finds it unlocked and opens it cautiously, wary of disturbing more cultists. As the door swings
open slowly, the half-orc hears a loud click behind her and turns to see another robed figure enter
through the western door.

Mond also heard the noise and turns in time to see the mage begin to move his hands in a familiar
pattern, similar to the leader's recent efforts. The sorcerer is quick to cast
[Counterspell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619072-counterspell), causing the enemy's hands
to emit the tiniest spark. Disappointment covers their face when they realize their fireball spell was
defeated before it even came to life in their hands. The spellcaster turns quickly and bolts back through
the door, shutting it loudly. The companions hear muffled shouts from behind it, "Push them up against
it! They can't get through!"

Closest to the door, Dolor pushes up against it, trying to force it open with all his strength and
is able to budge it enough to create a crack. Seeing this from the north wall, Gven bursts forward,
gaining speed as she approaches the wooden door and flings herself against it to aid the tiefling.
The door and those behind it temporarily lose the struggle, allowing it to open further, enough for
Bilwin to get an idea. As their opponents push back, closing the opening that Gven created, Bilwin
slides beneath the half-orc and tiefling to place his battle axe in its way, blocking it from closing.
Gven sets her feet solidly on the ground and with another surge of strength, the door flies open,
pushing back two robed figures and at least one wooden-post bed frame.

<!-- Round 1 -->

Following through on her mighty shove, Gven enters the room to see two robed figures falling backwards
from her forceful entrance. She stops momentarily in a short hallway that leads into a room that,
with a quick glance around, appears to be a resting area with a handful of beds. She invokes her
[rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/) and draws
Tempest Edge, looking at the closest mage without any prejudice or emotion, only raw irritation.
She stabs them in the fleshy part of their midsection and then her follow-up attack is blocked by
an [invisible barrier](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619019-shield).

The wounded man is suddenly surrounded by a [silvery mist](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619133-misty-step)
and disappears from the room, leaving the other robed enemy alone with an enraged barbarian. Defying
the look of fear on their face, the remaining mage raises their hands and releases a
[blast of cold air](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619042-cone-of-cold) towards Gven and the
others in the doorway.

Even standing behind his companions, the freezing air encompasses Mond, chilling him to the bone
and angering him beyond comprehension. With the natural speed and agility of his half-elven blood,
the sorcerer seems to glide past the others into the room and lays his hand on the mage's shoulder.
Uttering a few words under his breath, the sorcerer's hand shimmers and the mage writhes in
pain before whispering a [Counterspell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619072-counterspell) of
their own to stop the [vampiric touch](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619214-vampiric-touch).
Still, it was long enough to give Mond a bit of health for his efforts.

"Good, I see you've eaten your kale."

Picking himself up from the floor of the doorway, Bilwin pushes into the room and swings his
battle axe at their enemy. He slices through the magic user's robed sleeve, drawing blood from their
forearm and causing them to jump backwards.

Now behind everyone, Dolor notices that the first mage is behind them, apparently having
[misty-stepped](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619133-misty-step) to catch them off guard.
The tiefling turns and crosses the room, points a finger at the mage and speaks words in
[Infernal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Infernal_language). The magic user is
[engulfed in flames](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hellish-rebuke) and screams in pain.

"That's how you use fire."

<!-- Round 1 damage:
  Bilwin - 18
  Dolor - 37
  Grindlefoot - 18
  Gven - 18
  Mond - 37
-->

<!-- Round 2 -->

Still shivering from the freezing blast, Gven feels the anger rise from within, feeding the
barbarian rage she knows so well and focuses on the mage in front of her. Swinging her greatsword
from the hip and over her head, the half-orc slices cleanly through the magic-user's shoulder
on the downward stroke. The look of surprise is etched in the shape of their mouth as their eyes
glaze over in death and the body slumps to the floor.

Seeing the odds against him, the sole remaining mage moves to the center of the room, placing
himself between Dolor and the others. Once again, his hands move in a familiar pattern and a small
spark of fire begins to dance along his fingertips. Mond sees this and discerns from the mage's
location, that he intends to kill everyone around him, including himself, by dropping a fireball
at his feet. As the flames begin to quickly grow, Mond casts one more
[Counterspell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619072-counterspell), stopping the deadly
incantation. The mage turns to look at Mond with pure hatred in his eyes.

Before the mage can react, Mond flings a [mass of energy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/14761-chaos-bolt)
at him. Immediately after the bolt hits, the magic-user's face contorts in agony and his arms
undulate in agony from the poison coursing through his body. Within seconds, he falls to the floor,
adding one more corpse to the others.
