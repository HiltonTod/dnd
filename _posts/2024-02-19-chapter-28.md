Standing off to the side of the stone-laid street, the large half-orc throws back the hood
of his coat, seeming to invite the rain to touch his skin. Even in the dark of the night and
hampered visibility of the rain, the resemblance between Gven and her brother is uncanny.
They could have been twins for the likeness in their faces. He stands three to four taller
than his sister and his shoulders are maybe an inch or two wider, but he's only slightly more
muscular. Both of their hair is dark and long, pulled into a single braid down their back—keeping
it out of the way during battle. 

"You ask where have I been, sister. And I say, where have I not? I have journeyed far beyond
anywhere or anyplace I could have imagined. I have discovered much. I have found purpose."

Gven is incredulous at his nebulous greeting, completely lacking in warmth for the deep sibling
bond they once shared. "It's been eight years, Torp, and not a single word. Eight years that
mother and father, not to mention myself, wondered if you were still alive. And then a bard
passing through The Badlands hands me your amulet honoring Gruumsh. Father carved that
amulet for you, as he did mine, it's our family's symbol of survival and strength."

"As you can see, I have survived and I'm stronger than ever." He pauses and looks up into the
night sky, breathing deeply, feeling the rain on his face, and his mouth turns into a slight smile.
"The amulet no longer served me as it was meant to. Knowing what it means to mother and father, I
returned it to you, assuming my message was clear."

"Clear? What the fuck is clear about sending your amulet to us, without any sort of message?"
Gven shakes her head in annoyance and frustration, having finally found her brother, only to
encounter this unexpected version of him. "Okay, so you found some sort of purpose. What...what
exactly does that mean?"

At this point, Bilwin interjects "It's wonderful, this little family reunion and you two getting to
see each other again, but it's kinda wet out here. How's about we get out of this pouring rain
and grab a beer, or three?" Dolor and Mond nod in agreement, while Grindlefoot stands there
nonchalantly, completely dry in his new, very expensive and very weatherproof cloak and boots.

"But why would I want to do that?" Torp responds, once again looking up at the sky and breaking
into a grin that some might call nefarious. "I like the rain."

Bilwin nods his head a few times, "okay, okay then, I think I'll wait over here." He, along
with the others, moves to the other side of the street, underneath an awning covering a door
into a shop that closed much earlier in the day.










# TEMPORARY SUMMARY OF EVENTS

* Gven reconnects with her older brother, Torp, and discovers that he has become a zealot
  for one (or more?) of the old gods. He was lost at sea, saved by the gods, and brought
  to the island of Amonah. There he was taught (indoctrinated) that magic users are the
  ones who caused The Conflict, they alone are to blame.
* Torp returned to Elsemar using the disguise of Davanor, a Damian, with the goal of
  genocide—to completely eradicate magic users from Eritz.
* Davanor warns Gven and the others to leave Elsemar now, if they want to live.
* Gven and the others return to the Iron Vulture, where they realize that Cap'n Don is
  an [artificer](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/artificer) as he turns the ship into a faraday
  cage to protect them during the night.

Long rest....

* They go to the Broken Spy Glass to consult with Tella. Talk and stuff....
  * In the old tongue, "Davanor" has special meaning: "davan" is "to pray" and "or" is "to light."
    Torp took on the name as a symbol for his prayers bringing light to the world.
  * Elsemar was the seat of the clerical power in Eritz and Mirganor was the seat of arcane power.
* The group decides to set sail for the old, unknown island of Amonah and investigate
  where Torp learned about the gods and turned into a zealot.
  * They tell the harbor master that the ship is headed to the Northlands to trade, as a way
    of throwing Davanor off their trail.
  * Tella will give them supplies for their journey.
* They realized that they were viewing the holy symbol upside down. Turned 180 degrees,
  Bilwin recognized it as the symbol for B'raq (similar to [Talos](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Talos)?).
