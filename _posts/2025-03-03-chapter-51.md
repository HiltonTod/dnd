Having returned to the other side of the vast cavern of boiling, corrosive mud, the companions investigate the
one-way turnstile. Dolor's skill with locks and mechanisms doesn't reveal any way to reverse the direction
and allow them through. He turns to Gven, "Looks like we do it your way."

The muscular barbarian approaches the turnstile, plants her feet solidly on the rocky earth, grabs hold of the
bars, and begins to push with all her might. There's a bit of movement, but she can't quite break it loose and
she lets go in frustration. A [beam of blue-white light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2226-ray-of-frost) erupts
from Mond's hand, freezing the center of the mechanical device in the hopes of making it brittle and easier to break.
Gven grasps the bars again, joined this time by Dolor, and together they're able to slowly move the revolving barrier
several inches before something snaps and it breaks free. The half-orc slumps to the floor in exhaustion and then
gradually pushes herself up to stand, ready to move onward through the defeated gateway.

Meanwhile, enamored by his new, magical battle hammer, Bilwin holds it closely and stares intently at its intricate
carvings, [divining the object's identity](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619180-identify). Speaking softly
to himself, "This hammer is named Whelm and was forged long, long ago to strike back at the giants who invaded
its creator's home. It will give me an advantage when attacking and increase the damage, but, wait a minute, it's
afraid of being outdoors. It's agoraphobic! Oh, this is nice...when I strike the ground with the butt of its handle,
it sends a shockwave at my enemies. And it reveals secret doors. That's handy."

The companions pass through the room with the four remaining golems, motionless in a corner. Dolor suggests they
return to the room with the hanging orbs to rest. With only a single door, they can secure the room and rest with
some assurance to their safety.

Entering the room where the nine orbs hung from the tall ceiling, Grindlefoot notices the broken glass covering the
floor. Wanting to tidy up the place, the druid casts [Gust of Wind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619137-gust-of-wind)
to push the debris into a corner, out of their way. Unexpectedly, the gust is so strong that the smaller pieces of
glass and dirt fly up the wall, hit the ceiling, and come rushing back at the group. Having entered the room behind
the halfing, Mond takes the brunt of the naive assault, leaving several small cuts on his face and exposed skin.
Exasperated, the half-elf harumphs and then sits against a wall and closes his eyes. "I'm taking the last watch."

Long rest....

Waking after several hours of uncomfortable sleeping, the group breaks their morning fast with dry rations before
navigating their return to the sphinx's junction. The beast opens one eye to silently note their passage, but doesn't
offer any commentary as they turn into the center corridor, the only one not yet explored.

Halfway down the thirty foot long passageway, they encounter a small round room off the right wall. Beneath the foot
of water covering the floor, they can see a deeper pool within the cubby. Bilwin retrieves a copper from his
leather purse and concentrates for a brief moment, the [coin begins to glow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618996-light).
Tossing it into the pool they can see that it's close to ten feet deep and at the bottom, there is some sort of circular
mechanical structure.

"I venture to guess that wheel is attached to a valve somewhere, which might drain this water we've been mucking about
in." Dolor volunteers to investigate further and removes most of his clothing and belongings, setting them on the floor
next to the others. The tiefling wades into the pool, takes a deep breath, and dives below where the others can see
him attempt to turn the wheel.

Seeing his failure, Gven undresses to her smallclothes and takes the tiefling's place in the pool. Her second attempt
is successful, she's able to turn the wheel several revolutions. Off in the distance, they hear the sounds of gears
shifting and pipes rattling. As the half-orc returns to the surface, the foot of water in the corridor drains away,
leaving a thin layer of wet grime on the stone floors.

With Gven and Dolor clothed and armed once again, the adventurers continue northward in the passageway. The end opens
up into a large square room, easily sixty feet between each side. Most of the room is filled with water that is covered
in gunk and from what they can see, appears to be roughly fifteen feet deep. On the opposite side of the room, in the
northeast corner, an opening leads to another corridor continuing north. In the middle of the eastern wall, to their right,
is an opening that appears to be an adjoining room. In the most northern corner of the eastern wall, is a door. 
From where they stand, in the middle of the southern wall, a ten-foot wide ledge follows the wall to the western wall,
where it turns towards the northern wall and provides a path to the far passage. Looking closer, Mond notices that the
ledge has a six foot section missing along the western wall, making the way more difficult.

"Looks like there's only one way to avoid swimming." Bilwin gestures to their left and Dolor begins to lead them around
the side of the room.

As they reach the southwestern corner of the room, Grindlefoot notices that the seaweed-like gunk floating on the water
seems to be moving purposefully. "Hmm, that seems odd." Abruptly, two creatures with lengthy tentacles burst from the
water, spraying the companions with water and bits of vegetation.

## UPDATE THE MAP 

While the group recovers, Gustaf sits down and begins updating the map. The sad look on his face belies
missing his silent, grisly-looking, humanoid friend.
