Preparing to go below deck, Gven draws Tempest Edge from its sheath across her back. The half-orc's face settles into
a veneer of calm, the quiet before battle covering it like a mask leaving only the tips of her fangs extruding.
Now used to the gravitational pull in the Astral Sea, she steps over the hatch's edge and slowly floats downward.
Landing softly and quietly in the corner of the hold, Gven's
[darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Darkvision) takes effect almost immediately,
allowing her to survey the area. Interspersed with the hull's wooden frame, Redbud's roots have blocked off two areas
along the southern wall, leaving an area roughly shaped like a thirty-foot-long rectangle.

She sees six [creatures](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17157-grell) floating in various spots around the room.
Their heads are bigger than a prize-winning pumpkin and appear bird-like, but without feathers—or even skin—and show the
brain's curvatures and tissue. A large beak protrudes from its front, but no eyes that she can see. Dangling from beneath
the brain-like head are at least ten tentacles that reach the five feet to the wooden floor and end in several sharp barbs.
They take several seconds to notice her and begin moving slowly to investigate.

<!-- Round 1 -->

With Gleaming Blade drawn, Dolor follows Gven into the belly of the ship and lands behind the half-orc, his tail
providing natural balance to his landing. Noticing two of the parasites moving their direction, the warlock hurls three
[beams of energy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619161-eldritch-blast) at them in quick succesion. Two of them
connect with their respective targets, burning into their heads and leaving scorch marks.

Bilwin drops into the hold with less grace, but prepared for battle with his axe at the ready. The dwarf takes a
hefty swing at the closest creature, standing next to Gven, and slices through two of its tentacles. A
[beer stein](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon) appears floating next to the cleric and
shakes slightly, the only indication of its magical attack on the creature. The creature's beak opens in a silent
scream from the damage done by Bilwin's spiritual weapon.

The half-orc invokes her [barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/)
and slips around Bilwin to swing her greatsword at the first creature, slicing through several more of its tentacle arms.
The creature falters from its wounds and Gven rears back with Tempest Edge then drives it point-first into the middle
of the beast's open beak and completely through its head. [Thunder](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619179-thunderclap)
fills the enclosed room from the magical blade's strike and the skinless brain explodes into a pink mist, covering Gven
and Bilwin.

"Ewww, why'd you have to pop it like that?" Wiping the pink residue from his face, Bilwin exclaims, "Gross!"

Mond joins the others down below and moves to an unoccupied corner of the hold. Extending his hands at waist height,
a thin [sheet of flames](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618946-burning-hands) shoots forth at three of the beasts
grouped together. Each of their brain-heads appear singed and begin to ooze blood.

From the top deck, Dolor hears Grindlefoot, "It looks like there isn't much room down there, even for a little person like
myself. Holler if you need me!"

The [beast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17157-grell) closest to Gven attempts to bite the barbarian, but misses.
As it hisses, a barbed tentacle reaches out and latches onto her forearm, piercing her overcoat and drawing a small
amount of blood. The half-orc feels a compulsion to be still, to stop resisting, yet her rage overcomes the odd sensation.

Two of the parasitic creatures attack Mond at the same time. A beak breaks through the coat at his shoulder and he
winces in pain. Within seconds, each of his attackers jab a tentacle into his arms, leaving open wounds and a feeling
of unwilling immobilization. He shakes his head and regains focus; the feeling is gone. 

Another creature approaches Dolor from behind and chomps on the tiefling's back. He immediately turns around and points
a finger at it, unleashing [hellish flames](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hellish-rebuke) into its exposed head.

The remaining beast goes after Mond with its sharp beak, puncturing the sorcerer's upper arm enough that blood can
be seen through the jacket sleeve. Moving his hands slightly, a barely
[perceptible barrier](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619019-shield surrounds the half-elf.

<!-- The following is AI Overview of "describe the Lambent Zenith from Vecna Eve of Ruin"
  The Lambent Zenith (Zambient) is a crashed spelljamming galleon in the Astral Plane, central to Chapter 3 of Vecna: Eve of Ruin, where adventurers explore its wreckage, fragmented and embedded in the body of a dead god (Havok) to find the Second Fragment of the Rod of Seven Parts. This once-grand ship, captained by Inda Malayuri and powered by the Rod, was destroyed by Vecna, its pieces scattered amidst the god's corpse, now home to monsters and perils. 
Key Aspects:
   - Ship Type: A large, magical space-faring galleon, a "spelljammer".
   - Location: Adrift in the Astral Sea, specifically within the corpse of the dead god Havok.
   - Condition: Shattered into three main pieces (sterncastle, starboard section, prow) by the catastrophic impact, with parts lodged in the god's anatomy.
   - Crew: 
     - Inda Malayuri: captain
     - Figaro: first mate (locked himself in captain's cabin)
     - Illren: second mate, acting captain, male Giff (Space Hippo - https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Giff)
     - Zastra: crew member who initially finds them, Lysan's brother, male Githyanki (https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Githyanki)
     - Lysan: crew member who initially finds them, Zastra's sister, female Githyanki (https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Githyanki)
     - Kycera: female orc
     - Daveras: male elf, druid
   - Purpose in Adventure: Serves as a multi-layered dungeon crawl, a dangerous environment where players navigate wreckage, fight astral predators, and seek the next Rod of Seven Parts fragment.
   - History: Transporting passengers between planes when it encountered Vecna's destruction, leading to its demise and the scattering of its crew.
   - Visuals: Described as chaotic, with golden sails, glowing cosmic energy, and remnants of immense divine flesh. 

  In essence, the Lambent Zenith is a dynamic, multi-part shipwreck environment that players must explore to advance their quest against Vecna.
