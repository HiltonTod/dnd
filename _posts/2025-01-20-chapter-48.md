Still winded from their encounter with the group of zealot knights and catching their breath, the
adventurers look around the room. Similar to the room they left, the stream floats through this one,
from the northeast corner to an exit in the southern wall.

## UPDATE

From the southeast corner of the room, Gustaf calls out, "Could someone help me up? This damnable
sword won't stop talking to me and I thought it might shut up if I laid on it!" The small man is
stuck on his back, rolling to each side in comic attempts to get to his feet. "Hurry now, I need to
update my map!"
