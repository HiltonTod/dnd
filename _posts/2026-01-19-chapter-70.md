As the echo from Figaro's bellow fades into silence, Illren enters the room with a beaming smile
on his face. "Figaro! You seem more well! Nothing makes my heart sing more than this news!

The tiefling turns to glare at the acting first mate, "You are now who you say you are."
Illren opens his hands in a non-threatening manner and silently gives a questioning look.

"Drop the disguise."

"I know not what you speak of. It is I, your companion and friend. Many trials we have faced together,
fought and lived through battles."

Figaro turns to Kycera, sitting next to him on the bedside, "He's a monster!"

The orc turns a threatening scowl towards the Giff and in a hoarse whisper, "Illren, what have you been doing?"

"To keep us safe, everything I can! I've been the main stick of this ship, keeping everyone alive! You
know not what you speak of, your illness affects your mind."

Gven slides one of her daggers into a hand, ready for combat in the close quarters of the state room, if necessary.

Kycera moves to stand up, "I think we better step outside."

Bilwin moves his hands slightly, keeping them close to his waist and out of sight from Illren.
"Come now, my friendly associate. We know _something's_ going on, and you know we know, so you
also know we're going to find out, one way or another. Don't ya know. I
[suggest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619101-suggestion) you reveal the truth of what
you're doing on this ship with the crew."

Illren grimaces in pain, at first it seems mild, but then it grows and his face turns into a visage of
torture as he fights the compulsion to reveal his secret. His body shimmers and morphs into another shape,
with similar height and mass. The [massive beast is frog-like](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Death_slaad)
and stands on its hind legs, in humanoid fashion. Horns run from its forehead, across the top of its head,
and down its back, each one extending from five to ten inches out from its skin. More horns run along its
shoulders, like built-in paldrons, with smaller ones running down its upper arms. The arms extend to the
ground, even with it standing vertical, and the three large fingers on each end in deadly sharp claws.

<!-- The following is AI Overview of "describe the Lambent Zenith from Vecna Eve of Ruin"
  The Lambent Zenith (Zambient) is a crashed spelljamming galleon in the Astral Plane, central to Chapter 3 of Vecna: Eve of Ruin, where adventurers explore its wreckage, fragmented and embedded in the body of a dead god (Havok) to find the Second Fragment of the Rod of Seven Parts. This once-grand ship, captained by Inda Malayuri and powered by the Rod, was destroyed by Vecna, its pieces scattered amidst the god's corpse, now home to monsters and perils. 
Key Aspects:
   - Ship Type: A large, magical space-faring galleon, a "spelljammer".
   - Location: Adrift in the Astral Sea, specifically within the corpse of the dead god Havok.
   - Condition: Shattered into three main pieces (sterncastle, starboard section, prow) by the catastrophic impact, with parts lodged in the god's anatomy.
   - Crew: 
     - Inda Malayuri: captain
     - Figaro: first mate (locked himself in captain's cabin)
     - Illren: second mate, acting captain, male Giff (Space Hippo - https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Giff)
     - Zastra: crew member who initially finds them, Lysan's brother, male Githyanki (https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Githyanki)
     - Lysan: crew member who initially finds them, Zastra's sister, female Githyanki (https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Githyanki)
     - Kycera: female orc
     - Daveras: male elf, druid
   - Purpose in Adventure: Serves as a multi-layered dungeon crawl, a dangerous environment where players navigate wreckage, fight astral predators, and seek the next Rod of Seven Parts fragment.
   - History: Transporting passengers between planes when it encountered Vecna's destruction, leading to its demise and the scattering of its crew.
   - Visuals: Described as chaotic, with golden sails, glowing cosmic energy, and remnants of immense divine flesh. 

  In essence, the Lambent Zenith is a dynamic, multi-part shipwreck environment that players must explore to advance their quest against Vecna.
