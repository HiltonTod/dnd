As Bilwin and Gven look across the pit of embedded weapons, a humanoid figure emerges from behind the stone
sarcophagus on the far dais. It moves purposely with its head turned towards the two intruders. Where two
eyes should be are dark pits, from the slender torso extend long and distended arms that flop around its body.
It seems to have been startled by their entrance, even as it continues to move towards the front of its coffin.

"Why do we open doors? That was a bad idea! We're injured and could have used a short rest before
fighting another of these [lonely sorrowsworn](https://5e.tools/bestiary/lonely-sorrowsworn-mpmm.html). Remind
me next time, take a short rest **before** opening a door."

-->

<!-- Round 1 -->

Bilwin whispers a prayer to Hanseath, asking the dwarven god of carousing, brewing, and singing to
[bless](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2016-bless) his
friends during these troubling moments ahead. Looking around the room, the dwarf confirms that there are no
other doors and decides to cast the cantrip, [Sacred Flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618967-sacred-flame),
at the creature. Ethereal flames appear in the air above its head and quickly descend, causing it to screech in
anger and pain. 

Dolor enters the room in time to see the radiant flames descend upon the sorrowsworn. Making gestures with his
left hand, a [beam of energy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619161-eldritch-blast) explodes towards the
monster, hitting it squarely in the chest and pushing it back against its coffin. Still sore from their previous
encounter, the rogue actively [hides](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/combat#Hide) to avoid
being the target of its retaliation.

Entering the room behind the tiefling, Gven notes the pit of sharp weapons and distance separating them
from their foe. The barbarian grabs a javelin strapped to her back and launches it into the air, watching
it arc across the space and plummet into the creature's shoulder. It screeches in pain and anger at the continued
assault.

Moving around Gven, still on the western wall's platform, Mond moves his hands in specific motions that Bilwin
recognizes. [Fragments of fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618890-fire-bolt) erupt from the sorcerer's
hands towards the sorrowsworn, who manages to move to safety behind the casket just as the bolt slams against
the coffin. Only its head, shoulders, and three arms are visible.

Grindlefoot turns to Gven. "If you're willing, this spell will [help you traverse difficult terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618921-freedom-of-movement) like those pointy things sticking out of the floor."
The barbarian agrees to the spell, although she doesn't feel any differently after its done.

Bilwin looks at the halfling druid, "And this is the first time you thought to use freedom of movement? Seems
like it could have been useful, oh, MANY times before this!"

"I was a spider! Do you want to fuck yarn or do you want this?"

Mond shakes his head and says under his breath, "That escalated quickly."

The creature steps to the side of the coffin and slings one of its arms wide. The arm extends
across the pit, barely missing the dwarf's leg. No sooner has that arm retracted then another shoots out at
Mond, also narrowly missing the sorcerer. Letting out another screech in frustration, the creature moves
back behind its coffin for some protection.

<!-- Round 2 -->

With only the creature's head and shoulders visible, Bilwin hurls a
[bolt of light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt) and it strikes the same shoulder
as Gven's javelin. To his companions, "The next attack has advantage!" An
[ethereal beer stein]([Spiritual Weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon)) appears
floating in the air next to the dwarf, but it seems confused and doesn't attack.

Relying on his rogue-like agility, Dolor decides to brave the pit of weapons. Although moving as carefully
as possible, he reaches the halfway point with several cuts and slices and blood flowing from the many wounds.
Shaking his head in frustration, the tiefling suddenly turns into a
[silvery mist](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619133-misty-step) and then reappears in front of the
creature holding Gleaming Blade. Thrusting the sword deep into the monster's mid-section and twisting it
as he pulls it out, causing as much damage as possible. Before it can react to the surprise attack, the rogue
[hides](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/combat#Hide).

Inspired by Dolor's surprise attack and counting on Grindlefoot's Freedom of Movement spell, Gven invokes
her [rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/) and dashes into
the dangerous sunken floor. The others watch as her body seems to slide through the sharp weapons unscathed,
until she reaches halfway and loses her burst of energy. "Fuck this shit. I'm so damned tired." With a large
step to create momentum, she leaps for all she's worth and clears the remaining distance to the dais. Bloodied
from that last step through the embedded weaponry, she lands on the dais on the other side of the creature
from Dolor.

"Let's do this."

From the platform by the door they entered, Mond casts [Tasha's Mind Whip](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:tashas-mind-whip),
causing the writhe in psychic pain.

Grindlefoot concentrates for a moment, and a pale [beam of moonlight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2197-moonbeam)
suddenly shines on the creature, who is engulfed in ghostly flames. It howls in agony at the radiant damage,
the sound piercing and unsettling.

With Gven and Dolor flanking it, the creature lets out an ear-piercing screech that brings both of them to
their knees in psychic agony. During the half-orc's moment of weakness, the sorrowsworn lashes out
with one of its clawed arms, but it goes above Gven's head, barely missing.

<!-- Round 3 -->

Knowing what works for him, Bilwin casts [guiding bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt)
again. With the creature in melee combat with Dolor and Gven, it's moved out from behind the coffin and provides
a larger target. The bolt of energy slams into the monster's side, turning it slightly and causing it to
lean off balance.

Dolor sees his advantage and strikes with Gleaming Blade, thrusting it into the creature's stomach with
enough force that it pushes all the way in to the hilt. While still moving to defend itself, the creature
seems to have lost its enthusiasm for the fight.

Bleeding from the weapons in the pit and tired from their previous battle, Gven whispers loud enough for Dolor
to hear, "Fuck this, we're done." Pushing up from her kneeling position, she uses the momentum to swing Tempest
Edge with enough force to cut the creature in half. As its torso slumps to the ground, the half-orc stumbles
momentarily before catching her balance.

---

With their foe vanquished, Dolor searches the sarcophagus for any hint of information that might help them
find the crevice of dusk. The outside is elaborately carved with symbols that he doesn't recognize. The tiefling
looks to Gven for assistance with the coffin's lid. Working together, they slide it to the side and let it
clatter to the stone floor.

"I think we found our way back to Neverwinter." Peering inside the sarcophagus, Dolor sees a shimmering liquid
covering the bottom with a faint structure in the distance. Looking at the platform by the door, "But how do
we get them over here?"

"Don't worry, I've got this." Still consumed by her rage, the barbarian picks up the coffin's lid with both hands
and lifts it above her head. With an "ooomph," she throws it down on top of the weapons in the pit. The knives
and swords shatter at the weight of the stone lid. Stepping into the recessed area, Gven lifts the lid above her
head and throws it down on another section of the deadly weapons, pulverizing them. She does this over and over
until she's cleared a path from the door to the sarcophagus.

With newfound respect for the half-orc, Elden quietly comments to Mond, "I don't like her when she's angry."

Reaching the coffin, Elden confirms that it's a stable crevice of dusk. Before anyone can pose a question,
the elf shrugs, "Fuck you all," and jumps in, vanishing. The rest follow his lead.

---

Once everyone is through the crevice and safely in the Neverwinter Graveyard, Elden tells them how he was
abducted by the cultists. "Honestly, they didn't say anything or make demands, they just grabbed me from
the university grounds. I was walking along, minding my own business, when a sack was pushed over my head,
my arms pulled behind my back and tied, and I was led off to that crypt they used for sacrifices. I have no
idea why they picked me!"

Walking through the graveyard towards the main gate, the predawn sun began to light the area and they
could see the two guards at the entrance. "Lord Neverwinter told us to expect you. Please return to his
manor."

Reaching Lord Neverwinter's estate, the nobleman brings them into an elaborately decorated room with an
open casket. Inside is a woman with brown hair and unremarkable features, wearing a flowing black dress
and fitted bodice. Her eyes are closed, as though she' only resting.

"I see that you rescued Elden. Thank you for that. Alas, Indrina was not so fortunate. We discovered her
body in a cell inside the cultist's tomb." Lowering his head in mourning, "My mother was beloved by all
and will be missed."

Turning to Gven, "As we were preparing for the visitation today, one of my servants noticed this envelope
lying on her chest. Curiously, it's addressed to you."

Taking the letter from Lord Neverwinter, Gven unfolds it to read, "You move faster than we expected, but
we cannot leave you to your own devices."

The half-orc recognizes the handwriting, "Apparently, my brother is keeping tabs on us across the planes."
