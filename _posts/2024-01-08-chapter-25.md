Synopsis:

Leaving Mond on the Iron Vulture, suffering from something afflicting his guts,
the adventurers go to the warehouse at 2 AM. Seeing no lights inside, they climb a makeshift
ladder to the roof. Grindlefoot wild shapes into a giant spider, easily climbing the building
walls. The group surprises a half-elven guard, subdues them with spider's webbing, and knocks
them unconscious.
