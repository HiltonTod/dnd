With the zombie [tyrannosaurus rex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17041-tyrannosaurus-rex)
turned to dust and the [yellow musk creepers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Yellow_musk_creeper)
slashed to pieces, Nyx turns to the adventurers.

"Looks like my job here is done. Watch out for those yellow creeper flowers, they'll be on
you before you know it." 

Gven asks, "Before you leave, can you tell us how you came to roam this island?"

"I arrived here like most folks, on a boat. Despite my feline heritage, I was quite the pira, um,
sailor at one time. Like many ships on the Cracked Crystal Sea, mine ended up here. I'm quite curious,
probably because of my feline heritage, and discovered that this beautiful land in the middle of the
sea is hurting, perhaps even dying. I know what they say about this being the home of the gods,
and it probably can't die, but it sure is sick. Being a
[blood hunter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/357975-blood-hunter), my particular skillset is
quite useful when dealing with monsters of all sorts, which this island has in boat loads."

He pulls out a long knife and cuts a mark into his tabby-striped arm, alongside three others. "That
was the fourth undead T-Rex I've taken out in the year I've been here. Buggers keep not-dying, thanks
to these damned flowers."

After all this time using his [spiritual weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon)
in battle, Bilwin has finally noticed the floating hurdy-gurdy next to him. Wondering why his
instrument is floating and not in its case on his back, he reaches for it, but his hand swipes
right through the ethereal instrument. Realizing that his real hurdy-gurdy case is in his other
hand, the dwarf curses in his native tongue, "What ore-headed oaf lets their hurdy-gurdy fly about
all by itself!"

Nyx continues, "Why are you wandering around this inhospitable chunk of land?"

Dolor responds, "We're headed towards that temple on the mountain, looking for answers to questions."
With a brief glance at Bilwin, "We've been told by a...close acquaintance...that we'll find answers
there."

"I can see that you know how to handle yourselves, even if that large one," the tabaxi looks at
Gven, "is easily charmed by pretty things. That temple's a mystery. Used to be when I first discovered
it that folks would poke around it and then get back to where they came from. But not no more, now
they seem to go in and never come back out. Keep your wits about you, if you're determined to go
there."

Gven asks, "Would you be willing to guide us or help us understand what other troubles we might
encounter on the way?"

Shaking its head, "I can't guide you. My duties lie with the undead. But I can tell you this.
That mountain is dangerous, even moreso than the rest of this island. Keep your eyes and ears open,
your mouths shut, and don't play around with the carnivorous vines. They'd as soon eat ya while
that one over there," he nods at Gven again, "is smelling the damned things flowers. And keep a
look out for the bird folks. They might be friendly to ya...and then again, they might not. You
never know about birds."

Mond adds, "Valindra didn't mention anything about [aarakocra](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/4-aarakocra)
between us and the temple."

"Oy, beware that elven mage. I get a strange scent from that one."

Sliding the scimitar into its sheath, the muscular tabaxi adjusts its armor and prepares to
leave. "I'm off to find an undead lizard that lives in the seawater. According to the locals,
at least the ones who say they've seen it, it's supposed to be as big as one of these T-Rexes.
Should be an interesting encounter. Be wary." Before anyone can respond, Nyx lopes off into the
jungle.

Dolor leads the way towards the mountain temple, opposite from the direction Nyx was last seen.
The group falls into their routine order, Bilwin immediately behind Dolor, with Mond and Grindlefoot
in the middle of the group, and Gven as their rear guard. There's no sight of a trail, but they
push onward through the foliage and vegetation, keeping Nyx's warning in mind and trying to do
so quietly.

Roughly two hours later, they come to a break in the thick trees and are able to see the mountain
side up ahead. It's obviously closer and Dolor breathes a sigh of relief that they're making
progress in the right direction. With the thinning trees, Dolor notices that they're now on a
narrow pathway that appears to have been unused for quite some time. He warns the rest of the
group and then continues forward, wondering what they'll encounter.

After a few hundred yards, the trail opens up into a decent-sized clearing with enough room
for several roughly-made huts circled around the remains of a large fire pit. The vines, flowers,
moss, and other vegetation has begun to overtake the crude dwellings, and from the distance they
seem to be in a state of disrepair.

Without moving into the small village, Dolor is able to see scorch marks on the buildings, as
though they were struck by lightning. Analyzing the surroundings with more intent, the tiefling
notices that the scorch marks on other buildings are horizontal, not how natural lightning would
behave. He notices even more charred lines and singed areas on the ground, reinforcing his gut
feeling that these weren't made by natural causes.

Mond peers at the fire pit, trying to deduce if the charred lumps are wood logs or humanoid
corpses. Everyone begins to feel a chill on the backs of their necks.

"This place is creepy. I say we avoid it and go around." Grindlefoot supports his statement and
suggestion with a visible shiver of his whole body. The rest of the group agrees and they
decide to sneak around, but keep it in sight so they can be aware of anything—or anyone—that
might happen.

The halfling casts [Pass without Trace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618849-pass-without-trace),
allowing them to conceal their passing more easily. Dolor and Gven are completely undetectable,
given their natural stealthiness. While the rest of the adventurers are louder than the tiefling
and half-orc, they pass quietly enough to avoid detection by anything untoward.

As they reach two-thirds of the way around the village, Dolor crosses a path leading away from
the village. Looking to the side, he can see a rocky path that leads up a short hill to a stone
structure about 30 feet away. A body is lying in the path. Not wanting to chance an ill-fated
encounter, he ignores the alternate path and continues to move ahead.

As Mond crosses the narrow path, he looks at the building and thinks that he sees the symbol of
B'raq on the stone building. "Hold. That looks like the symbol of B'raq up there. We should take
a look."
