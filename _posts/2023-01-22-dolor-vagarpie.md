## Backstory

Dolor's parents, Amar and Alegría were well known jewelers and watchmakers, renowned for their exquisite craftsmanship. They roamed Eritz traveling the Ha-derech from Mirganor to Elsemar and back. They offered they skills acting as tinkers and craftspeople to the various communities and cities they encountered during their travels never charging more than they thought their clients could afford.

The family valued craft and artisanship and this was instilled in both Dolor and his sister Lucha, she developed her skills as a painter and Dolor focused on turning sand into glass. Both of them created beauty in their own way just as their parents did.

Eventually as he grew older, Dolor realized that some of the rich clients his parents created for would later refuse to pay the agreed upon fee, especially when they heard what other less fortunate people had been charged for work. This chafed him as unjust and it didn't take long for Dolor to realize that locks were much less complex than the watches and clocks he had been working with all his life and that he had a natural talent for being stealthy and finding ways into place he wasn't supposed to be in. These discoveries led him to "help" those nobles keep their word, even if they did not do so willingly, thus sending him down the path of the rogue and while the time his family spent in cities means he is very comfortable there, their lifestyle on the road and in the wilds while between cities made the Scout emphasis a given.

While he is still close with his family, Dolor wants to more deeply discover his future as a rogue and doing so while traveling with the family could put them at risk so he decided it was time to make his own way and discover his own path. 
This is what led him to be on the road that fateful day he met the others (and Ben).

Update on Dolor's background, when Doug changed him from being pure rogue to Rogue 5/Warlock 3.

From Messenger Nov 2, 2024 (9:44 AM):

Doug: yeah, I think a respec is coming for Dolor as he discovers that he leans more towards magic than just hack and slash and delves into that part of his legacy and personality

Doug: part of what is driving this is the realization that his artistry and glass blowing has always leaned on this without his conscious awareness and he is now becoming cognizant of how much he already lives in that world

Doug: there will always be a rogue in his heart but the fighter feels like a path diversion he took due to assumptions and misunderstandings of what he truly needed to be himself

Doug: honestly, it was pretty interesting to me how when I stopped thinking about DnD and just thought about Dolor and his life, the choices were pretty simple (I was min maxing without realizing I was min maxing)

From Messenger Nov 5, 2024 (8:38 AM):

Doug: I went ahead and respecced Dolor to Rogue 5/Warlock 3 (taking Warlock to 5, then we will see)
Genie patron and pact of the blade made sense (pact weapon is the gleaming blade), still the scout subclass in Rogue

Doug: After traveling with Mond and Grindlefoot, Dolor has realized that he and his entire family have hidden from their legacy  because of the magic that is innate to them, this is a huge part of why he is so bent on addressing wrongs that he sees, he has spent his life feeling like he needs to hide who he truly is

Doug: All of the people asking why he is here, have finally made him realize that not only does his honor demand it but also he needs to address this so he can embrace all of himself.

Doug: As for where the fighter stuff went, in my mind, when he reached out to the Genie to enter into the warlock pact, he was given the option to abandon the recent training in the martial world in exchange for gaining power in the arcane world, he embraced that bargain which is how we ended up rogue 5, warlock 3 (giving up rogue makes no sense to him since it is such a core part of who he is and his history)
