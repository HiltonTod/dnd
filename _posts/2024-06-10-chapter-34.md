After their encounter with the [harpies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16919-harpy),
the group is ready to put down somewhere around the island. Based on their reconnaissance,
Cap'n Don provides some options.

"We cuid pit in at an empty grotto west o' the island, but the only way onto land is by
climbin' the steep cliffs that surround it. I cuid drap ye aff at a wee lagoon that's
surrounded by jungle, but it's too shallow tae harbor the Iron Vulture and I'd need tae
sail aroond while ye're aff adventurin'. We'd need a signal o' some sort so I ken when
tae get ye. Or there's a wee cove that looks tae be used by ootlaws, but ye'd hae tae
pretend tae be, well, pirates. Whit dae ye say, lads?"

<!-- English version
We could put in at an empty grotto west of the island, but the only way onto land is by 
climbing the steep cliffs that surround it. I could drop you off at a small lagoon that's 
surrounded by jungle, but it's too shallow to harbor the Iron Vulture and I'd need to sail 
around while you're off adventuring. We'd need a signal of some sort so I know when to get you. 
Or there's a small cove that looks to be used by outlaws, but you'd have to pretend to be, well, 
pirates. What do ya say, lads?
