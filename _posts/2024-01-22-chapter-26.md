# When rain comes to town

The group wakes mid-morning on the Iron Vulture to find the predicted rainstorm has arrived. 
It is akin to a verical river. 
The group heads to the Iron Vulture to update Tella on the what they discovered in the warehouse.
Gven seems to have caught the stomach problems Mond had last week and stays on the boat.

Passing through the market, it is clear that no one is happy about the rain. 
Everything and everyone is either damp or, if less well prepared, soaked.
The merchants are range from subdued to surly and the few customers that are about move quickly to buy necessities and get back indoors.
Life in the city continues on. 

The party enters the Iron Vulture via the back door. 
The rain has kept customers away here as well. 
The only people in the place appear to be Tella, behind the bar tidying up, and a dripping-wet Rightside, huddling dangerously close the fire.
Tella greet the party as they enter, reflexively asking what he can get them to eat and drink. 
Rightside looks as you'd expect a wet cat to look: stringy body, matted fur, and a foul expression. He's mumbling "I-hate-being-wetting" over and over as he works to dry himself.

Tella listens as the group outline the events of the previous night. 

Tella thinks for a bit, then says, ...


Rightside speaks up from over by the fire, "Sometimes we get sad, Tella. My mother had a medallion she kept wrapped in special cloth. She only brought it out on important occasions, or when things were really hard. She'd say a prayer and we'd feel like we weren't alone.  It always helped us feel better."  





## Notes 



The big rain storm has arrived and it is pouring down in sheets.  Everything damp or soaked. 

The market is very subdued.  

(What did we get for food?) 

We Go to see Tella

### Tavern

Tella: 
Talks about how regulating / outlawing use of magical and clerical powers is what it is but magic everywhere (including people such as Mond) and the people still have an innate need for connection with higher powers of their choosing.
So there is a grey area. The Eyes of the Star and Hands of the Wand keep the peace.   Magic and Religion may not be practiced openly, but they are still there. 

Rightside says:
Sometimes we get sad. 
Mother had a medalion in the house 

Tella:
Goddess of charity - Sedocra - 

Red headed halfling still working at the pub:
Ro'qu-ell-a

University - City Center - Uphill from the doughnut shop
Prof. Verin - Aarakocra

### Out in the Rain

Grindlefoot buys a quality cloak and boots - So happy, best thing ever
Complimentary tin of oil to maintain water proofing

### University

Find our way up hill to the University and then to the library 
Stone construction

Up the stairs to find Verin in a class/research/lecture hall

Ancient seat of the all the pantheons of the gods of the modern world
Group of Islands off the mainland 
Turbulent waters and sea serpents 

Many gods, different for each  race, but the same story
Don't know what or who the gods are, but they are powerful and derive energy from worship.  Story goes at one point there was a hole in the earth from which the gods emerged. Made their home in different aspects.  And then they closed the hole. 

Map we found with the islands is in rough agreement with professor's understanding

Amonna, Ba-it, Kuht,  

Student, TA was interested in these talk, Dark hair, human, Julianne.

Crossbow imbeds in the blackboard near Verins head and we turn to see: 
* 2 Cloaked figures 
* 3 others in leather armor
