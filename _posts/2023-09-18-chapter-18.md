Gven leaves the Broken Spy Glass through the back door and makes her way through the alleys
around the building to the front of the pub. She stops at the corner, waiting to enter the main
street as she watches the passersby. Approaching from her left, she sees two official-looking
types with their hoods up headed towards the pub's front door. She deftly enters the sparse crowd
heading the opposite direction, blending in and avoiding a second glance from the two strangers.

Meanwhile, the rest of the group mills about inside the Broken Spy Glass, waiting for representatives
of the Eyes of the Star and Hand of the Wand to arrive—as they know they soon will. Just before the
pub door opens, Tella reminds the group to be honest, but don't offer up any extra explanations.
Two strangers enter the common room and pull back their low-hanging hoods. A dark-haired half-elf
and purple-skinned tiefling stand before the group of adventurers and Tella with deep frowns on their
faces.

Tella turns towards the half-elf, "Fine night for a visit, eh, Lithia." He then nods his head to
the tiefling, "welcome, Sirith. How might I be of service?"

Lithia, the half-elf member of the Hand of the Wand, looks around the room, taking in the overturned
tables and chairs and the unconscious hooligans, "looks like you know why we're here." She sighs
heavily and passes a slow look over each member of the group, ending on Tella. "It's unlike you
to get involved in these sorts of affairs, Tella. Let's see if we can get this wrapped up quickly."

Lithia and Sirith listen to Grindlefoot recount the unfortunate altercation with Davanor's thugs.
After a few questions and a drinking salute to Bilwin's deity, Hanseath, Lithia puts on a pair
of glasses and slowly looks around the room. "Yep, it all checks out. These folks were minding
their own business and tried to dispel the situation before it got out of hand. Let's head back
to the Hall, Sirith. You get to write up the report this time." Sirith suddenly looks irritated
and mumbles something under their breath that the group can't quite hear. "Oh yeah, do you want
me to tell the chief about that time with the Dragonborn a few months ago? I didn't think so."

Tella turns to the group, "that went better than I expected. You're lucky we got those two.
Lithia is pragmatic and Sirith isn't the sharpest sacrificial dagger in the drawer. Now,
drinks are on the house and I'm curious...are y'all interested in work?"
