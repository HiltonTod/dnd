The adventurers leave The Gilded Glyph, everyone with a satisfied smile from the well-spent gold
coins. Their newly acquired magical gear infuses them with confidence to face the unknown perils
of a foreign plane. Having traveled through various regions of Elsemar, they're accustomed to
adapting to unknown cultures and behaviors. Fortunately, arcane and clerical magic is widely
accepted in these lands, allowing them a freedom none of them have ever experienced before.
