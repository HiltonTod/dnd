The bolt smashes against the chalkboard, embedding itself amidst the scribbles and
notations from Professor Verin. Everyone turns to see two cloaked figures standing by
the doorway into the classroom and four others in leather armor, slowly spreading
outward from the door. One of them is stopped a few paces from the cloaked assailants
at the door, still aiming their crossbow at the group by the chalkboard—apparently
the one who missed the professor's head by only a few inches.

Professor Verin drops to the floor as quickly as possible and hides behind the sturdy
table where the ancient map is laid out. Dolor can barely hear him mumbling, "That Tella,
this is the last time I do a favor for him. I don't care how 'interesting' the subject
matter. It's not worth losing my feathers or beak!"

Fight choreography:

<!-- Initiative rolls
  Gven - 10

<!-- Round 1 -->
* Grindlefoot turns quickly and throws his dagger at the mercenary holding his crossbow,
  missing his head by a few mere inches.
* Mercenary 1 leaps at Dolor with their longsword, causing 11 slashing damage with their
  first swing and missing on their second.
  * Dolor reacts with [Uncanny Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#UncannyDodge-347),
    reducing the damage to 6.
* Mercenary 2 attacks Gven with their longsword, missing on their first swing and connecting
  on their second for 9 damage.
* Mercenary 3 attacks Mond swings their longsword twice at Mond, missing the first one and
  causing 8 damage on the second.
* Mercenary 4 is hanging out at the door to the room and fires a crossbow bolt at Bilwin,
  narrowly missing.
* Dolor attacks Merc 1 with Gleaming Blade, connecting twice for 16 damage.
* Robed-cleric 1 casts a bolt of dark crackling energy at Dolor and misses, then a shining black sword
  appears in the air next to Dolor and misses its swing at the tiefling.
* Robed-cleric 2 casts a similar bolt of dark energy at Gven and misses, then follows with another
  shining black sword that hangs alone in the air and swipes at her, causing 7 damage.
* Gven invokes her [barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/)
  and swings her greatsword at Merc 2 twice, connecting both times for 13 and 18 damage—they
  suddenly look quite vulnerable.
* Bilwin is visibly upset about almost being skewered by a crossbow bolt and attacks Merc 2
  with his [hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy), causing 8 damage and killing them.
* Mond casts [Mind Spike](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mind-spike) at Merc 3 for 6 damage and
  follows that up with a [Shadow Blade](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shadow-blade) attack that misses.

<!-- Round 2 -->
* Grindlefoot casts [Haste](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/haste) on Dolor, who can suddenly
  move twice as fast as normal, and then throws his knife at Merc 1, barely missing them.
* Mercenary 1 attacks Dolor with their longsword, causing 8 damage.
  * Dolor again reacts with [Uncanny Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#UncannyDodge-347),
    reducing the damage to 4.
  * Merc 1 swings at Dolor again and connects for 11 more damage.
* Mercenary 3 swipes their longsword at Mond, only connecting on the first attack for 8 damage.
* Mercenary 4 leaps across a table at Gven, hitting her with their longsword twice for 6 damage.
* Dolor swigs a healing potion, regaining some health, then attacks Merc 1 with Gleaming Blade
  for 17 damage and missing on his second swing.
* Robed-cleric 1 casts [Eldritch Blast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/eldritch-blast) at Dolor
  and misses, as does their magical sword.
* Robed-cleric 2 casts [Eldritch Blast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/eldritch-blast) at Gven
  and misses, but their suspended magical sword connects for 4 damage.
* Gven attacks Merc 4 with her greatsword, connecting on both swings for 15 and 11 damage.
* Bilwin swings his hurdy-gurdy at Merc 4, missing on his first attempt then thumping them on his
  second for 6 damage.
  * Almost subconsciously, he casts [Spiritual Weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spiritual-weapon)
    and it appears as a floating beer stein that attacks Merc 4, causing 10 damage and killing them.
* Mond attacks Merc 3 with his two daggers for 15 and 6 damage.
* _Mercenaries 2 and 4 are dead, leaving two more mercs and the two robed clerics still alive and fighting._
