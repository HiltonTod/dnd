Returning to Hallix Mausoleum, the group enters the crypts, pass through the first room into the
second and turn right, carefully traversing the caved-in tunnel to the room where they finished
off the [wights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17059-wight). On the north wall, there are two
more doors for them to investigate, one to each side of the room where they discovered Sarcelle
Malinosh. At the west wall, a short set of stairs leads up to a landing and the closed door with a
large painted eye. In the southern wall, another caved-in tunnel leads into darkness, next to a
pile of stone rubble in the southeastern corner.

"Shall we see what lies in these other doors, next to the sorceress's prison cell?" Dolor opens
the unlocked door to the left of the cell and moves forward cautiously. It seems to be a storage room,
filled with all sorts of supplies. Crates, boxes, and large bags are stacked against one of the walls.
On two other walls are shelves containing lanterns, dry food stuff, casks of water, manacles, chains,
and more.

Two flasks catch the tiefling's eye and upon closer inspection, they both have "take to feel better"
scrawled across their fronts. Suspicious of their surroundings, Gven suggests Bilwin verify
they're healing potions and not something nefarious. Accepting the flask from Dolor, the cleric
removes the stopper, takes a sniff and casts [Detect Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619097-detect-magic).

"Oh no, these aren't going to help anyone who drinks them. Quite the opposite, really." He moves
to put them back on the shelf, but Gven suggests they might come in handy sometime.

"Indeed, they might." And he puts them into a special pocket within his
[Bag of Holding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4581-bag-of-holding).

Dolor moves to the door to the right of Sarcelle's room and opens the unlocked door to find a small
room, ten feet along each wall. It's dominated by a large iron grate in the center, easily five
feet across each way. Moving close to the grate, Gven bends down to investigate and sees that it
covers a shallow pit holding a golden harp, sheaf of papers, and piece of cloth that appears
to be saturated in blood.

Before reaching through the grate's five inch wide openings, she studies the iron enclosure more
closely. The half-orc notices blades inset around the edges of the stone encasing it. Pressing
ever-so-lightly on the grate, the blades begin to move inward—a trap for anyone who attempts to
reach through and grab the items below.

Dolor retrieves a crow bar from his backpack and attempts to use it as lever to open the grate, but
it's too heavy. Giving Gven a look, she takes the crowbar, wedges it into the narrow opening between
the grate and the stone's edge, then pushes down with all her strength. Her neck and arm muscles
bulge in effort for several seconds before the edge of the grate gives, folding upward and making
a larger opening.

"I got this!" Bilwin inches closer and a [spectral hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2173-mage-hand)
appears next to him. The dwarf's concentration is obvious as he moves the floating hand through the
opening created by the crowbar and retrieves each of the objects.

Mond takes the cloth from the magical hand and discovers that it's a torn edge, likely from a cloak or
coat. It's completely saturated by dried blood.

Dolor examines the harp, even playing a few chords with some sense of aptitude, to find that it's a
finely made, yet unenchanted harp.

The ethereal hand brings the papers to Bilwin, who begins to shuffle through them. "This one looks
like a map of a large estate and this one is a schedule, including locations, times, and events.
What's this scribbled in the margins?" He turns the paper slightly, so he can read the handwritten
words.

"'Her secrets will make a worthy sacrifice.' What's that mean? Oh, here's a name written on
one of the pages: Indrina Lamsensettle. That's the actor Lord Neverember wants us to find, right?"

Moving back to the previous, larger room, Dolor ascends the stairs to the door with the painted
eye and opens it warily. The doorframe is short, forcing the tiefling to duck as he goes through
it into the small room beyond. The walls are built from stone, not bored through solid rock like
the tunnels below ground. It appears to be a crossroads of sorts, with a door across the room,
opposite from the one they entered, and four bells hanging from the ceiling in a line from one
doorway to the other.

Grindlefoot looks around, "We're back at ground level. I think this might be along that stone
fenceline we saw, the one that separates the two parts of the graveyard, between the rich and
poor."

Dolor says to the group, "Before we head into the fancy crypts, shall we finish exploring the
paupers side? We didn't investigate that caved-in tunnel on the southern wall."

Everyone nods in concurrence and they return, with Gven forgetting to duck and knocking her
head on the low doorframe. "Damn short doors! No offense, Grindlefoot or Bilwin."

"None taken! But that does remind me of the Fucking Duck. What a great name for a dwarven-owned,
and dwarven-sized shop! Clever dwarf, that jeweler."

Once again, Dolor leads them into the southern tunnel. It goes for fifteen feet before opening
into a room almost as large as the one they just left. It's filled by a large, square pool
of water, contained by a raised stone wall that reaches Gven's knees. The structure easily
measures twenty feet on each side. There's a five foot space between it and the wall on all
sides, allowing them to navigate around the room.

Two round, rusty metal pipes run across the ceiling, from the east side to the west, each about the
circumference of a cantaloupe. Hanging immediately below them is a slightly smaller pipe in a circular
shape above the pool, with water dripping down into it from several small spickets. The circular area
of piping appears to be fed by another pipe that comes into the room from the northeast corner,
moves along the top edge of the wall, and then takes a 90 degree turn south to connect to it.
Four hallways exit the room; two on the eastern wall, one on the west wall, and
the last in the southwest corner of the southern wall.

Tentatively approaching the water, Dolor sees that it's fairly clear and notices shiny objects
at the pool's bottom. As he moves closer to get a better look, he discerns that there are watery
creatures swimming around, noticeable by the movements they make. Suddenly, two spouts of water
emerge from its surface in snake-like shapes, writhing in various ways and reaching several feet
above the water. A moment later, another [water elemental](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17051-water-elemental)
rises from the water, this one in a humanoid shape that reaches four feet high. It begins gesturing
towards Dolor and the others with its liquified arms and hands, apparently communicating in its
own bubbly language.

"I knew this would come in handy," Dolor says as he casts
[Comprehend Languages](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2035-comprehend-languages) and begins
conversing with the elemental being.

After a few minutes of conversation back and forth between the elemental and Dolor, the tiefling
recaps for the others.

"It says we don't look like the others, 'the robed ones,' and we aren't cruel like them. I think
they might be prisoners."

In the spirit of friendship, Bilwin offers his magical beer stein to the human-shaped elemental.
"Here, I don't know if you drink beer, that might actually be cannibalism for you, but it's how
we make friends."

It looks at the stein closely, inspecting it without touching it, and then pats Bilwin on the head.

Dolor translates, "No mood for fighting today. Friend offer escape, but tiny. No fit. Like this
water. And shiny things," it points downward, to the coins in the bottom of the pool.

"One of you in room," and it points towards the hall on the south wall. "Look for robes that wave
wand and watch eye. Nearby, another creature, one of fish, not friend of robes, live here." It points
down again, "Shiny things mine."

Bilwin thanks the water element and tosses it a gold coin, which it deftly catches and then quickly
tosses to one of the snake-like elementals, who begin playing catch with it.
