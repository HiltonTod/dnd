Leaving the small cove behind them, Dolor leads the way into the jungle swinging a machete
to open up the narrow path. Bilwin follows closely behind, still savoring the flavor of
Boscoe's brew—with which he has conveniently filled his magical stein. Mond is entranced
by their surroundings, captivated by the plethora of sights and sounds vying for his attention.
As a [Circle of the Land druid](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/515-druid-101-circle-of-the-land),
Grindlefoot barely even notices the path, moving deftly through the thick vegetation as though
it were an open field of pleasant flowers. Bringing up the rear, Gven keeps one hand on Tempest
Edge's hilt and the other catching the thin branches and vines that attack her face, snapping
back into their regular position after kindly making way for Grindlefoot passing in front of her.

The dense jungle vegetation encroaches on the barely visible trail that winds northward towards
their destination, the mountainside temple. The sunlight drips through the thick canopy of leaves
and branches over their heads, casting more shadows than light. Lush ferns and lengthly vines
choke the undergrowth, completely covering the path at various points. The air is thick with
the smells of sweet berries—that they dare not eat—and the damp earth below their feet. Screeches
and bellows fill the air, a wild chorus of animals they can only imagine because they're
camouflaged by the surrounding plants.

After a few hours of slowly moving northward, Dolor catches a scent in the air and Bilwin
recognizes it as fresh blood. Moving cautiously, the tiefling enters a small space where the
ground cover and plants are trampled. He sees a large animal's bloody carcasse lying there,
obviously having been very recently killed. Within seconds, he hears rustling in the bushes
and a very large lizard comes crashing into the clearing. The twenty-foot tall
[tyrannosaurus rex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17041-tyrannosaurus-rex) sees Dolor
and gives a tremendous roar, staking its claim to the prey before them.
