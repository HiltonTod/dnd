Having left Tella at the Broken Spy Glass, the group returned to the Iron Vulture to discuss
their next steps. Pretty quickly, they agreed to investigate Davanor's warehouse, through
whatever means necessary. Mond's dinner hadn't agreed with him, so he decided to stay on the
ship, watching from the crow's nest, in case something went awry.

Around 2 AM, Dolor, Grindlefoot, Bilwin, and Gven make their way to the warehouse. They stick
to the shadows thrown by the buildings and the darkness of a moonless night. To be certain of
their secrecy, Grindlefoot casts [Pass without Trace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pass-without-trace)
as they approach the warehouse. The streets are empty and it's dark inside the building, no
evidence of people inside.

They spy a built-in ladder on one side of the building, something that most of the taller
structures have for maintenance and in case of fires. While Gven leads the way up the ladder,
Grindlefoot [wild shapes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/635-druid-101-wild-shape-guide) into
a [giant spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16895-giant-spider)—that seems useful
for silently climbing things and investigating in the dark.

When they reach the roof, it appears to be empty, but they can't quite see the portion above
the front doors, which is 80 feet away and just out of range for their
[darkvision](https://roleplayersrespite.com/darkvision-5e). As they're clearing the roof before
heading inside, Dolor knocks a loose board and they see a figure turn and look in their direction.
The human guard peers into the darkness for several seconds, crossbow at the ready, before
dismissing the sound and turning back towards the street down below. "Damned rats are everywhere!"




<details><summary>Synopsis:</summary>

Leaving Mond on the Iron Vulture, suffering from something afflicting his guts,
the adventurers go to the warehouse at 2 AM. Seeing no lights inside, they climb a makeshift
ladder to the roof. Grindlefoot wild shapes into a giant spider, easily climbing the building
walls. The group surprises a human guard, subdues them with spider's webbing, and knocks
them unconscious.

Descending into the warehouse through the trapdoor, Grindlefoot's giant spider gets stuck and
Gven and Dolor help push him through. Casting webbing as he falls, Grindlefoot catches himself
only a few feet from the floor and certain injury. They find the warehouse empty of people and
begin their investigation in the office. 

In the office, they discover detailed ledgers of the shipments coming to and from the warehouse,
including some from Amonah with the letter "P" noted next to them. Gven notices that the ledgers
trackl arrival date, number of crates, origin, and an initial. The most recent time a T is listed
is 2 weeks ago—T for her brother, Torp. Looking in the desk drawer, Dolor notices a piece
of paper with a symbol on it that looks like a skewed W inside a circle.

In the center of the warehouse, Grindlefoot has discovered a half-opened crate with several
different sized coins and medallions. Bilwin realizes that they're holy symbols—and are highly
illegal since the Conflict. They leave the warehouse, undiscovered and with the unconscious
guard wrapped up in a spider's web. Return to the Iron Vulture for a long rest.
