As the echo from Figaro's bellow fades into silence, Illren enters the room with a beaming smile
on his face. "Figaro! You seem more well! Nothing makes my heart sing more than this news!

The tiefling turns to glare at the acting first mate, "You are not who you say you are."
Illren opens his hands in a non-threatening manner and silently gives a confused look.

"Drop the disguise."

"I know not what you speak of. It is I, your companion and friend. Many trials we have faced together,
fought and lived through battles."

Figaro turns to Kycera, sitting next to him on the bedside, "He's a monster!"

The orc turns a threatening scowl towards the Giff and in a hoarse whisper, "Illren, what have you been doing?"

"To keep us safe, everything I can! I've been the main stick of this ship, keeping everyone alive! You
know not what you speak of, your illness affects your mind."

Gven quietly slides one of her daggers into a hand, ready for combat in the close quarters of the state room, if necessary.

Kycera moves to stand up, "I think we better step outside. Figaro needs to rest, for real."

Bilwin moves his hands slightly, keeping them close to his waist and out of sight from Illren.
"Come now, my friendly sailor. We know _something's_ going on, and you know we know, so you
also know we're going to find out, one way or another. I
[suggest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619101-suggestion) you reveal the truth of what
you're doing on this ship with the crew. We need to know the something that you know."

Illren grimaces in pain, at first it seems mild, then it grows and his face turns into a visage of
torture as he fights the compulsion to reveal his secret. His body shimmers and morphs into another shape,
with a similar height and size. The massive beast is [frog-like](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Death_slaad)
and stands on its hind legs, in humanoid fashion. Horns run from the center of its forehead, across the top of its head,
and down its back, each one extending five to ten inches out from its skin. More horns are visible along its
shoulders, like built-in paldrons, with smaller ones running down its upper arms. The arms extend to the
ground, even with it standing vertical, and the three large fingers on each end in deadly sharp claws.

Illren roars in defiance and rushes from the room, knocking Bilwin out of the way and heading towards the
stairs.

Gven turns to Kycera, "It's your ship, what do you want us to do?"

The orc responds in a low growl, "Get that fucker!"

<!-- Initiative rolls:

-->

<!-- Round 1 -->

At the fastest speed she can manage through the narrow halls and steep stairs of the Lambent Zenith, Gven
dashes after the beast formerly known as Illren. She makes it back through the mess deck and two flights of
stairs to the top deck, where she sees the creature standing close to the main mast. The barbarian
[invokes her rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/) while the
creature appears confused about what to do next. It looks around, searching for its escape when it notices
the half-orc on deck.

"I will feed!"

It rushes Gven, slashing at her face with the lengthy claws on one hand, narrowly missing as she twists to her
side and backwards. She doesn't have time to avoid the other hand and the sharp claws slip through the open front
of her coat, cutting into flesh through her shirt. Before she can recover from the successful attack, it pulls close
and bites her neck, the sharp teeth puncturing her skin. Within seconds, both of Gven's wounds begin to show signs
of decay and withering flesh.

Feeling the necrotic wound on her neck, "What sort of bastardly beast are you?"

Bilwin appears at the top of the stairs in time to hear Gven's curse and see the creature pull away from its bite.
An [ornate beer stein](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon) suddenly appears floating next to
the cleric and swiftly flies to within a few feet of the creature. The beast stares at the hovering mug in confusion,
then a powerful force smacks it along its shoulder and it grunts in pain.

<!-- Round 1 damage:
  Bilwin - 0
  Dolor - 0
  Grindlefoot - 0
  Gven - 21, 12 necrotic
  Mond - 0
-->

<!-- Round 2 -->

The half-orc grabs a healing potion from her belt and swigs it, immediately feeling some of her strength returning
and her wounds smooth over, leaving the congealed blood on her skin. Tucking the dagger into her belt, she draws
Tempest Edge from its sheath across her back. The creature's bulbous head moves quickly, evading the greatsword's
first swing. Baring her tusks and gritting her teeth, the half-orc deftly reverses the blade's direction and catches
the beast by surprise, slicing through the upper portion of its leg.

A moment later, Grindlefoot emerges from below to the top deck and sees Gven injured and standing alone against
the creature. The druid mutters a few [healing words](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619143-healing-word)
and the barbarian feels another surge of strength return. A second later, without much concious effort, the
halfling [Wild Shapes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/635-druid-101-wild-shape-guide) into a 
[giant wolf spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16900-giant-wolf-spider) and moves to the side of the deck.

Mond reaches the top deck immediately behind the halfling and steps to the side of the doorway, allowing those behind
him freedom to join the fight. The sorcerer raises both hands to waist level and a
[bolt of lightning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618999-lightning-bolt) arcs toward their enemy. The pink
lightning reaches its chest and turns wild circles around its torso for several seconds. It screams out in agony.

Standing next to Illren's beast, Gven notices that some of the wounds she and the others have inflicted are healing
on their own. Under her breath, "What the hell's next? This damned thing can heal itself too!"

It's difficult to read any intent or emotion in the amphibious eyes, but the half-orc is close enough to think
that she sees the glimmer of a deadly smile in them. One webbed hand turns upright and a spark appears, floating
just above its palm. It tosses the [small ball of fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618887-fireball)
over Gven's head so that it lands between her, Mond, and Bilwin.

Fortunately, Mond saw the small spark at the same time as Gven and is able to
[counter the spell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619072-counterspell). Bilwin watches the small spark travel
over the barbarian's head, growing in size as it begins its descent to the deck. Just as its about to touch
the wooden decking and explode into a fiery mess, it dissolves with a puff of smoke. The creature roars in anger
at the thwarted attack.

Dolor exits the door from the lower decks and sees the spark of fire go poof. The warlock quickly realizes they're
under magical attack and hurls three [beams of light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619161-eldritch-blast)
at the beast in quick succession. From the teifling's position by the door he has an obscured view of Illren; Gven
is up close in melee combat and the others are dispersed around the deck. The first two beams slam into its muscular
body, the crackling energy briefly sizzling its flesh. The final attack goes slightly wide, missing the beast—and
Dolor's companions, thankfully.

Bilwin moves along the deck rail to gain a clear shot and releases a
[bolt of light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt) that shocks his companions with its intensity.
The cleric has cast this spell dozens of times and never before has it been so bright or intense. The mass of energy
slams into the creature, pushing it backwards several feet, sliding across the deck. The amphibious body is covered in
charred skin and the creature screams out in anguish and anger. A few seconds later, Bilwin sees portions of the skin
smooth over from some sort of natural healing ability.

<!-- Round 2 damage:
  Bilwin - 0
  Dolor - 0
  Grindlefoot - 0
  Gven - 0
  Mond - 0
-->

<!-- Round 3 -->

Seizing the opportunity, Gven lunges at Illren, stabbing it through one of its legs. It recoils in pain and narrowly
evades her follow up attack, a slash at its arm. The barbarian snarls at the beast, cracking the dried blood on her
cheek from its earlier attack—thankfully healed by Grindlefoot.

From a siderail, Grindlefoot—in the body of the large spider—shoots webbing at the beast, attempting to ensnare and
restrain it. Illren dodges the silk trap and then sees the spider scurry over the railing, out of sight on the outside
of the hull.

Mond looks to the creature and focuses his mind into a force of
[dominance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619148-dominate-person). With as much mental force as he can muster,
the sorcerer sends the telepathic message, "Stop attacking."

All of the companions hear the creature's telepathic response, "Your arcane tricks do not work on me."

<!-- The following is AI Overview of "describe the Lambent Zenith from Vecna Eve of Ruin"
  The Lambent Zenith (Zambient) is a crashed spelljamming galleon in the Astral Plane, central to Chapter 3 of Vecna: Eve of Ruin, where adventurers explore its wreckage, fragmented and embedded in the body of a dead god (Havok) to find the Second Fragment of the Rod of Seven Parts. This once-grand ship, captained by Inda Malayuri and powered by the Rod, was destroyed by Vecna, its pieces scattered amidst the god's corpse, now home to monsters and perils. 
Key Aspects:
   - Ship Type: A large, magical space-faring galleon, a "spelljammer".
   - Location: Adrift in the Astral Sea, specifically within the corpse of the dead god Havok.
   - Condition: Shattered into three main pieces (sterncastle, starboard section, prow) by the catastrophic impact, with parts lodged in the god's anatomy.
   - Crew: 
     - Inda Malayuri: captain
     - Figaro: first mate (locked himself in captain's cabin)
     - Illren: second mate, acting captain, male Giff (Space Hippo - https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Giff)
     - Zastra: crew member who initially finds them, Lysan's brother, male Githyanki (https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Githyanki)
     - Lysan: crew member who initially finds them, Zastra's sister, female Githyanki (https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Githyanki)
     - Kycera: female orc
     - Daveras: male elf, druid
   - Purpose in Adventure: Serves as a multi-layered dungeon crawl, a dangerous environment where players navigate wreckage, fight astral predators, and seek the next Rod of Seven Parts fragment.
   - History: Transporting passengers between planes when it encountered Vecna's destruction, leading to its demise and the scattering of its crew.
   - Visuals: Described as chaotic, with golden sails, glowing cosmic energy, and remnants of immense divine flesh. 

  In essence, the Lambent Zenith is a dynamic, multi-part shipwreck environment that players must explore to advance their quest against Vecna.
