It's mid-morning and the group has settled into their quarters on the Iron Vulture.
Not wanting to waste any time, they hatch a plan to investigate Davanor's warehouse
more closely.

In the privacy of a cabin, Grindlefoot [wild shapes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/635-druid-101-wild-shape-guide)
into a [rat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16891-giant-rat) and clamors into Dolor's pocket.
Leaving the ship, the group splits up to avoid notice. Bilwin sets up at a busy corner
close to the warehouse's front door, pulls out his [hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy),
and begins to tune the instrument to his own unique tastes. The two muscular guards pay
little attention to him, or much of anything else, for that matter.

Dolor and Gven meander through the crowd slowly, as though they're talking business
while taking in the salty sea air and other pungent smells that city docks are renowned
for. Shortly past the building's front door, at an alleyway, Dolor stoops down as though to
adjust his boots, and gives Grindlefoot the signal. Grindlefoot quickly hops out and
scurries off into the alleyway, in search of a subtle entrance into the warehouse.
Intent on their own business, the crowds passing by the warehouse and surrounding buildings
barely notice the tiefling and half-orc, let alone the rodent.

Mond trails the group, keeping distance between them so that he can monitor any unusual
activity or interest in the group. A block away from the warehouse, he pauses to listen to
a red-haired female halfling playing a violin—and it's lovely, like nothing he's heard
before.
