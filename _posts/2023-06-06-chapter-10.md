As the morning light begins to illuminate the small clearing through the densely packed
forest around them, the adventurers wake, feeling well rested and energized. Their
shared experiences are creating a bond and allowing them to grow stronger as a team.

Elar is already awake, and upon further examination they can tell that he hasn't slept
at all during the night. As they begin to talk with him, Elar shares that he is upset
with himself for not being able to escape and save Vera earlier, while he was being held
captive by the goblins. The group consoles him and, finally, Gven says "what's done is
done and now's the time for action. Let's go get her."

As they pack up their campsite, careful to leave it as pristine as they found it for
Lyra Swiftarrow, Elar shares what he knows about the hill giant, also known as the Great
Mouth. The hill giant lives up the mountain, above the treeline, in a protected area
that appers to have been created by an avalanche, some time in the past. Vera would
sit on the arm of his haphazzardly pieced together stone throne while the goblins visited
with their offerings. Otherwise, she was "kept" in a small shelf-like area that offered
her some protection from the weather.

The group returns to the cave entrance, so that Elar can get his bearings and take
them up the mountain, to save Vera from the hill giant.

During their trek through the forest, Grindlefoot casts
[Pass without Trace](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/pass-without-trace), allowing
them to move silently and without disturbing their surroundings. Like most folk in
Eritz, Elar is suspicious of anything that seems like magic and curiously notices
their tracks seeming to disappear behind them. When they reach the treeline, the
ground becomes more barren, with small boulders and low-lying shrubs sparsely populating
the area.

As they stand in the cover of the trees, the group can see a large collection of rocks
and boulders about 400 feet up the mountain. Elar confirms that area as where the hill
giant lives and is holding Vera hostage. They can barely make out a large boulder
that is split into two large pieces, likely during the avalanche, that have been
positioned to create a pseudo-throne. Other large boulders have been placed as
arms to the giant-sized chair, providing a perch for Vera while the Great Mouth
is holding court. The large seat is currently empty.

They can see a well-used path from the treeline to the giant's sanctuary and Elar
confirms it is the approach used by the goblins. With his keen vision, Dolor spies
a smaller, less-worn, winding path off to the side that appears to approach the giant's
dwelling from a different direction. The adventurers decide to follow the less-worn
path, attempting to be stealthy in their approach and rescue Vera with the least
amount of resistance.

Gven leads the way up the winding trail, followed by Xantic, McGillicutty, Elar,
and Grindlefoot, with Dolor bringing up the end of the line. Because it's used much
less, the trail is covered with loose rocks and dirt. Halfway up the switchback
path, Gven loses her footing and slides all the way down the mountain side, disturbing
the rocks and creating more noise than they'd hoped to. She embarrassingly lands at
the bottom of the hill, then they hear a loud groan, similar to a yawn, coming
from the rocks above them.
