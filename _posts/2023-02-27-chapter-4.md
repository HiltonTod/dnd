The Mixed Nuts and Low Elves are still in the thralls of their battlelust from fighting
each other over the Heroe's Wart, even though Ben has valiantly gotten them to pause momentarily.
It's fortunate that he's done so because the [chimera](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Chimera)
is upon them, and with a vengeance!

The fantastical beast lands with a loud crash on the wagon, emitting a deafening roar from the
lion, a glimpse of fire within the dragon's mouth, and a "baaaah" from the goatâ€”it was meant
to be threatening but came out in a mild-mannered tone, amusing the adventurers.

Grindlefoot becomes acutely aware of the chimera egg he's holding and with his eyes wide, slowly
backs up to hide in the tall stalks of Heroe's Wart surrounding them. The chimera doesn't
waste anytime, sizes up the parties in front of it and chooses the biggest target, Gven.

Fight choreography:
*   Chimera - The dragon head breathes fire at Gven, causing 15 damage and knocking her
    to the ground. The flames hit Cabanna (the tiefling), Magnus (the nobleman), and Grak (the
    goblin), also dropping them to the ground in pain. Cindel and Ben are also singed by the
    dragon head's fire, but are healthy enough to maintain their senses and mobility.
*   Gven has enough strength to quickly down a healing potion and gain 12 points of health
    before swinging her longsword at the lion's head and hitting to cause 15 damage.
*   Dolor misses with his short bow.
*   Cindel yells "huzzah!" to draw the chimera's attention while attacking with her bow, hitting
    the beast with her second arrow to cause 10 damage. As she's firing her bow, she directs
    Ben and the Low Elves who are still standing to get their hurt comrades to safety. "This
    never should have happened," she says with a look of despair on her face.
*
