<!-- Guest player: Jolivette Shevitz as Dave Chevits -->

At the end of the fifty-foot long hallway, a wooden door with a heavy bar laid across
its front, preventing it from being opened. Dolor looks back to the others for approval
before lifting the metal beam from its place, securing the door—and whatever they'll find beyond it.

The rogue tiefling leads the group into a large room, 30 feet wide and 15 feet deep, that is ornately
decorated and lavishly furnished. Filling one corner of the room, is a four-post bed with a mountain of
sheets, comforters, and pillows that could comfortably fit four regular-sized humans, two half-orcs, or at
least six halflings. Along the west wall, an elaborate buffet, complete with gold filigre and
ornamental hardware, is laid out with all sorts of food delicacies and a fine choice of drinks.

Standing next to a leather-bound reading chair, one of a pair along the south wall, is a blond halfling.
Their hair falls below their shoulders, facial features are narrow and angular, slightly regal even,
and their body is slim yet sturdy. Wearing finely-made leather armor, they hold two large knitting needles,
deftly moving them while creating what appears to be a scarf.

"Please join me. It's been a long time since I've had visitors. Would you like some coffee, tea, or
perhaps a taste of wine? The cold brew is especially fine, one of my favorites." She indicates the
buffet to her left, filled with liquid and solid treats.

"My name is Dave Chevits, no relation to the less well known and infinitely less charming, David Shevitz.
They end their spelling with the letter Z, which is barbaric—no offense, my lovely barbarian." The halfling
gives a slight nod to Gven before continuing. "I like to get that out of the way. For some reason everyone
in Eritz thinks we're kin." Continuing to skillfully move her knitting needles, "What may I do for you fine
folks?"

Dolor is the first to recover his wits, "I'm curious, how did you get trapped beneath a ziggurat filled
with deadly creatures?"

"Oh, that's a long story. Not nearly enough time to get into that, my dears. Let's skip past the
pleasantries, although that's something David Shevitz would do and I'm loathe to be compared." They
grimace at the thought, but goes on. "I believe this is what you're looking for."

From underneath the enormous bed, the halfling pulls a blanket, then another, and then several more.
"As you can see, I've had quite a bit of time on my hands and I so enjoy knitting. Would anyone care
for a blanket? Guaranteed to be as comfy as the soft down fur of a baby bug bear." Continuing to search,
they pull bags of trinkets, jewelry, and coins.

Finally, reaching farther underneath the bed, Dave slides out a greatsword contained in a pitch black
scabbard. "Ah, here's what I'm looking for! I believe they call it Blackrazor."

Surprising the rest of the party, Gustaf moves forward and grabs the pommel to inspect it closer. He
slides the first foot out of its dark black scabbard, revealing the obsidian dragonscale blade
of the greatsword. Mond feels a strange, creeping dread come over him, as do some of the others, based
on their expressions of fear or misery. Gustaf sees their reactions and returns the blade to its
home, instantly relieving their overwhelming sense of dismay.

Grindlefoot looks around, "Why do you all look constipated? It's only a sword."

Gustaf looks to the halfling, "Did you not sense the blade's unmitigated desire to kill? Did you hear
the power in its voice? It filled my mind, urging me to attack all of you at once, to send you to the
void. Being an educated man of science and philosophy, it had no impact on my superior mind. Yet, it
sang glorious songs of battle, attempting to intimidate me, to convince me that I should attack you.
Alas, that is not my way."

Bilwin moves closer to Gustaf and reaches out to touch the sheathed sword, casting
[Identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2152-identify).
"Oh, it's very powerful! Whomever wields it in battle will have great advantages. And it's sentient!"

Gustaf sighed, "I already told you that."

"Yes, it's quite a magnificent blade, albeit, extremely dangerous to the wielder. Here are a few more
trinkets you might like to bring with you when we leave." Dave, the halfling, hands Dolor 100 platinum
pieces, 50 electrum pieces, a potion of greater healing, and a scroll of protection against fiends.
"What say you, shall we venture beyond this door and see what other excitement awaits?"

TODO: GUSTAF AND THE SWORD

---

The adventurers leave the halfing's small prison cell and as the door closes, the food and snacks
that Bilwin had stowed away in his clothes and backpack suddenly disappeared. "Aw, that's too bad.
I was looking forward to those scones with my beer, later. Let's go see that floating stream. I bet
it has all kinds of fancy floating fish or, maybe, there'll be sharks!"

The group returns the way they came, navigating the destruction of the ziggurat. "You sure were thorough
in here," Dave comments as they take in the water-logged carnage. They climb to the top level, exit
the ziggurat room, and make their way through the passage to the room with the stream and kayaks.

Floating two feet above the room's floor, the stream is only three feet deep, allowing plenty of space
between it and the room's ceiling. Several fish swim along with the current, most of them nondescript
and all of them uninterested in the spectators. The creek enters the room through an opening in the
west wall and leaves through one in the northeast corner, both with five feet of space between the top
of the water and the tunnels' ceiling. Bilwin sticks his arm into the water and feels it
pulling him inward, although he's able to keep his balance and position outside of the stream.

The group decides to see where the water goes and ties four of the kayaks together, hoping it will
keep them from getting separated with whatever they might encounter in the tunnel. Gven holds a
kayak up against the water, resting one end on the top of the stream while Grindlefoot and
Bilwin climb aboard. When they're ready, the barbarian lets go and they disappear into the tunnel.

Dolor and Dave Chevits are holding the second kayak in place. Gven quickly holds it up against
the stream, like the first one, allowing the tiefling and halfling to board and take off down the
waterway. Next, Mond and Gustaf follow the same pattern, allowing Gven to help them launch their
kayak. Gven's kayak is the last one in the line of boats tied together. She holds the narrow
boat up against the stream, quickly launches it into the water, and performs a twisting jump to
land inside and facing the proper direction. The rope at the bow pulls tight and her kayak moves
slowly with the current, into the dark tunnel ahead.

---

In the lead kayak, Bilwin and Grindlefoot move slowly into the deepening dark for a minute or longer,
before Bilwin touches the bow and casts [Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618996-light). The
kayak begins to illuminate the bare tunnel walls, both above and below the water line. The riders
notice the current slowing even more as it encounters a slight incline. They hear rushing water
up ahead and within a matter of seconds, their boat hangs momentarily on the precipice of a drop into
the unknown ahead. The weight shifts forward and the narrow vessel shoots downward, gathering speed
with the current, turning to the left, then slightly to the right, and back to the left again.
The waterway levels out for a short space, drops further downward, jettisoning them forward even
faster, and then back upwards, until it finally flattens out. Grindlefoot can tell that they're headed
westward when they both see a light ahead.

The small boat with the halfling and dwarf enters a room and the floating stream takes a soft turn to
the left. As they peer around the room, they notice several warriors outfitted in black plate armor
standing off to each side of the stream. Before they can respond, their kayak rides the stream
through an exit on the other side of the room. Looking backward, Grindlefoot says, "I wonder who
they are and what they want?"

Following the first kayak, Dolor and Dave enter the room in their boat, only to discover a large
fishing net strung across the floating creek. They quickly become entangled in the rope prison and
unable to move. Looking around, they see warriors dressed in black armor surrounding them with swords
drawn. 

Dolor yells as loud as he's able, "It's a trap!"

Grindlefoot barely hears Dolor and then the rope attached to their stern goes taught. "Help me Bilwin,
we need to pull ourselves back to that room. I don't think those warriors are friendly."

Mond also hears Dolor's warning and turns to Gustaf, "prepare to jump as soon as we enter that room
up ahead. Keep that sword away from any battle, we don't want it persuading a random fighter to take it."

Further back in the tunnel, relying on her darkvision, Gven senses trouble ahead—not that unusual,
really—and readies herself for action.





Gustaf hurriedly updates the map in his leatherbound journal.
