Standing in front of the entrance to the temple to Aish, Bilwin shakes his head in horror at its
desecration. "That these...these...heathens would do such a thing to another divinity's sacred place
of being is completely...unconscionable!" Without turning to the group, his earnestness is aparent.
"We must make this right."

Standing behind Bilwin, the rest of the group stares into the 8-foot wide open entrance with the
double doors swung open, seeing only impenetrable darkness. Curious at what might be inside, Grindlefoot
picks up a small rock and tosses it towards the doorway. Without looking away from the doorway, Bilwin's
arm snakes out and his hand grabs the stone out of the air as it flies by.

Turning his head slightly to face Grindlefoot, Bilwin grins. "We don't want to hurt the bees, now do we."

With a flick of his wrist, the rock flies over the side of the mountain and Bilwin enters the darkness
of the temple. Dolor shrugs his shoulders and follows. With a flutter of excitement, Gustaf hurries after
the dwarven cleric and tiefling. "Oh my! So much to see! So much to catalog!" Only slightly less curious
than Gustaf, Grindlefoot skips off behind the archaeologist. Mond and Gven exchange a brief look
of understanding and the half-orc motions for the sorcerer to go ahead, she'll bring up the rear.

Making their way down the entrance tunnel, periodic gusts of hot air blow outwards, accompanied by
low groaning. The walls are slick with condensation from the increasing temperature reacting with the
moisture in the air. A slight bend in the corridor hides what little light from the open gate illuminated
the area. They find themselves in a small chamber, roughly fifteen feet across, with a rusty metal staircase
spiraling down, into the depths of the mountain. Next to the stairs are skeletal remains of some long
dead adventurer—or zealot—wearing decaying leather armor.

Grindlefoot approaches the corpse to investigate, pronouncing the obvious. "They've been dead a long time."
With the light of a torch, he's notices a crumpled piece of paper in the decomposing hand. The halfling
gently retrieves it, careful not to tear or rip it as he unfolds the parchment, and hands it to Gustaf.

> Come to me, if you have the faith<br>
> and will to prove your worth.<br>
> But I do not eat from an empty plate<br>
> So you most prove your worth<br>
>
> Deep within these hallowed halls<br>
> Three great treasures hide<br>
> Bring them to me, one and all<br>
> And your worth I will decide.<br>
>
> The first, called Wave, requires battle<br>
> With the beast in the boiling bubble<br>
> 'Cross cavern vast, where the chain-links rattle<br>
> Lies Whelm, past water-spouts double.<br>
>
> Blackrazor yet remains to be won<br>
> Underneath inverted ziggurat.<br>
> That garnered, think not you're done<br>
> For now you'll find you're caught.<br>
>
> Your choice is made, it can't be undone<br>
> It's time to see this through.<br>
> Great and glorious am I, the One!<br>
> Death or glory? It's up to you.<br>

After reading it aloud, Gustaf ponders for a moment. 

"That's an old legend, told to children
around campfires and at their bedtimes, although this is a bit darker than I recall. Clear as
day, though. Retrieve the three items, most likely weapons, for this One and get a reward.
Pretty standard adventurer-type stuff, but it could be interesting. Although, the author could
have used an editor. Evocative imagery and clear structure, but the cadence is uneven and they
are quite repetitive with the phrasing." With a shrug of his shoulders, "Oh well, shall we proceed?"
