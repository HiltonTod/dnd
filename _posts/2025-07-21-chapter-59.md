Peering into the immense hall from the door that Bilwin abruptly opened, the dwarf and Dolor see
the caged elf hanging from the ceiling in the center of the hall. Six robed figures stand around the
poor captive, sweating from the sustained efforts of their spellcasting.

From the northwest corner of the northern wall, the doorway allows them a clear view of the entire
chamber. It opens onto a balcony that spans the eighty foot width of the room, extends forty feet from
the west wall into the room, and two stairwells on either side descend fifteen feet to the lower floor
in the middle of the room, where the captive hangs. Another balcony abuts the eastern wall, almost
two hundred feet from its opposite, and can be accessed from the lower floor with stairs on each side.

Standing at the edge of the balcony, a robed human intently watches the ceremony below him, apparently
the group's leader. Hovering behind the man in a protective manner are five one-eyed creatures, exactly
like the one they encountered only minutes ago.

Suddenly, the captive elf screams, "Get out of my head! Get out! You can't have my secrets!"

A one-eyed creature scans the room and sees the two companions; it immediately moves towards them with
obviously harmful intentions.

<!-- Round 1 -->

Bilwin sees the monster approaching and instinctively responds by casting
[Invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619116-invisibility)
on himself and Dolor, as well as Gven and Mond, who are standing behind the tiefling. Doing his
best to get out of the creature's path, the dwarven bard quietly moves toward the stairs that
lead down to the lower floor and the robed magic-users. The barbarian and sorcerer can suddenly
see into the room and understand that it's most likely something Bilwin did, purposely or not.

Dolor realizes that he's suddenly invisible, but knows that they've been discovered and closes
on the leader with Gleaming Blade. Catching the magic-user off guard, the tiefling's short sword
slices through the man's robes and leaves a trail of blood behind it. Dolor immediately becomes
visible to everyone. As the robed man grunts in agony and surprise, Dolor deftly retrieves a
healing potion from his belt with his other hand and swigs it, instantly feeling the much needed
healing effects. 

Whispering to herself, "Here we go again," Gven moves towards the leader, invokes her
[barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/),
and swiftly pulls Tempest Edge from its sheath. Still invisible, the cult leader doesn't expect
her attack and is, once again, completely surprised by the blade of her greatsword cutting through
his flesh. Presuming this is the leader and will attack them with all his power, she summons Tempest
Edge's innate magic and a bolt of lightning streaks through the blue-tinted sword into the cultist.
His body convulses from the unexpected energy and she takes further advantage of his state with
another swing of Tempest Edge that carves into his side.

Realizing that he's suddenly under attack and in a bad position to retaliate, the leader dissolves
into [a mist](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619133-misty-step). Seconds later he reappears on
the balcony at the other end of the room, momentarily safe from the swords of Dolor and Gven.
He looks deeply into Gven's eyes, seemingly removing the physical distance between them, and whispers
"[Defend me](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619148-dominate-person)!" The barbarian considers the
command for a mere second before embracing the rage inside her. "Fuck you, wizard."
