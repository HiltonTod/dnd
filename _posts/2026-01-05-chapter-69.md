Facing the two crew members, one with her greatsword drawn and anticipating a problem, Bilwin reaches into a
pocket, pulls out two breakfast rolls and tosses them at the end of the sword. The first roll bounces off the
tip of the sword and falls to the ground, while the second one misses the blade and boinks the sailor in the
forehead.

Before she can react to the doughy assault, her companion snickers loud enough for the group to hear, "I don't
suppose you'd be attacking us with baked goods if you really meant us harm." 

The two of them glance at Tempest Edge strapped across Gven's back, Gleaming Blade in its sheath at Dolor's hip,
and then each of the others, assessing their readiness for combat. She lowers her sword as Bilwin giggles,
picks up the rolls, and takes a bite of one. "No waste for the weary. At least, I think that's what they say."

The tall female's patience is obviously wearing thin, "Again, what brings you to the Lambent Zenith?"

Before the companions can contrive a story, Dolor decides to go with the truth. Below the tiefling's horns, his
pointed ears twitch slightly, "We're trying to find a piece of a magical rod that will help us stop Vecna—a
narcacisstic demi-god of some sort—from destroying our world, all worlds really. The latest clue led us here,
to this ship."

The male looks at his companion for a moment and something unspoken passes between them. "I'm Zastra and this is
Lysan. I can't imagine anyone one in their right mind leading with that story if it weren't true. Not sure what
we can do for you, though. We don't have any magical rods hanging about."

Dolor's tail begins to rhythmically swish back and forth, like a slow metronome. "I can appreciate that, and yet,
your ship is our only lead. Can you tell us how the ship came to be here and in this," he gestures around the
deck where two thirds of the ship is missing, "predicament?"

"We were traveling the Astral Sea, like any other day, and set upon by a fever of
[cloakers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16826-cloaker). Damnable beasts with arms that look like wings on 
either side of their flat, wide body, and pointy barbs along their six-foot tail. That isn't so unusual, in and of
itself, but during the battle some sort of massive energy burst tore the ship into three pieces." He stops and thinks
to himself for a moment, "Hmm, now that you pose the question, that does seem coincidental. During our travels,
Captain Inda came across some magical item that she harnessed to power the ship. And it worked, too." He scratches
his chin, "Perhaps a little too well. The ship's pieces, with us clinging to them, fell to this forsaken god's body,
and it's where we've been ever since. That was two, maybe three months ago. We've tried to venture out into the
stony terrain you see around us, but there are some vicious creatures all about. Haven't been able to check in
with the crew who were in the other parts of the ship. No idea if they're alive, like us, died in the crash,
or became a meal for the unnatural beasts roaming around." He shrugs his shoulders in resignation.

Moving in closer from the edge of the group, Grindlefoot looks to Zastran, "What's your captain's plan? Surely
they haven't been sitting around doing nothing this whole time."

"Ah, the captain isn't on this part of the ship. We hope she's still alive on one of the other pieces, but Illren is
running things around here. He's actually the quartermaster. Our first mate, Figaro, has been sick ever since we laid
eyes, and feet, on this damnable stony hunk of a dead god. As to a plan," he glances at Lysan, "Illren's not too keen on
logistics, keeps saying wait for the captain to come to us. Speaking of, I'll go find him. Wait here."

The slender humanoid leaves them on the ship's deck under the careful watch of Lysan. Within a few short minutes,
he returns with an even taller creature, easily over eight feet at the tip of its large head. They wear a
hip-length coat constructed of red velvet that must have a stretchiness to it, because it's bulging at the seams
from the enormous arms contained within. The deck thuds loudly with each step of the massive humanoid
[hippopotami]((https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Giff)).

"Ho, visitors! And ones who aren't trying to eat us, what a beautiful day! I'm Illren, the acting captain since our
first mate is feeling a little under the weather. Zastran here tells me you're on a quest. That's a thing we can
always get behind. What can I do for you fine folks?"

Dolor retells their tale with a few more details and then asks, "What ails your first mate? Both our cleric and druid
might be able to help?"

The large hippopotami glances at Gven and her sheathed greatsword before answering, "We don't rightly know. He's
locked himself in the captain's cabin and won't come out. Goes on telling me to 'keep things afloat while I rest
up and don't bother me.' We take him at his word, leaving him to hisself."

"What about the other parts of the ship and the crew?" Gven prompts Illren and the others, "You say that you've
tried to venture out into the surrounding area, but met resistance. Can you see them from here? Is there a way to
communicate with them?"

Zastra is the first to respond, "We can take care of ourselves when we need to, but them creatures out there are
something out of a legend or nightmare. The other ships are too far away to yell at or hear and we can barely make
them out from the top of the mast."

Considering her [eagle eyesight](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior#toc2), Gven asks the Githyanki,
"Can you take me up for a look? I have a certain advantage seeing things at a distance."

Zastra gestures towards the main mast and moves that way with Gven close in tow. They both quickly scramble up the
main stick, and the sailor's look reveals a newfound respect for the barbarian's agility. Reaching the crow's nest,
Gven can now see the stony terrain with trees, bushes, and all sorts of foliage that appears to be made of stone.
Several small waterways meander across the landscape and are solidified liquid, as though frozen in a moment of time.

Zastra points to the southwest, "There's the prow—that's the very front of the ship. Not sure if you're a sailor or
landlubber," he follows up with as a means of apologizing for the explanation.

"Mostly the latter, but I've spent some time on the water, and in the air." She smiles a bit at the thought of
Cap'n Don Karnahge and their time on his flying ship, the Iron Vulture.

"Over there," he points to the southeast, "that's the starboard side of vessel. Everything else broke up into smaller
pieces than we can see from here."

Looking in both directions, the crashed pieces are well within the 1 mile limit of her eyesight, but the terrain
and foliage hide most everything from view. "I can see them clearly, but they're too obscured to see anything useful."

The half-orc's neck begins to tingle and she notices that Zastra is fidgety. "Something on your mind, friend? This group
of ours often finds ourselves in unique positions where we can help folks. Whether it's the gods or fate, I can't say,
but that seems to be the way of things."

<!-- The following is AI Overview of "describe the Lambent Zenith from Vecna Eve of Ruin"
  The Lambent Zenith (Zambient) is a crashed spelljamming galleon in the Astral Plane, central to Chapter 3 of Vecna: Eve of Ruin, where adventurers explore its wreckage, fragmented and embedded in the body of a dead god (Havok) to find the Second Fragment of the Rod of Seven Parts. This once-grand ship, captained by Inda Malayuri and powered by the Rod, was destroyed by Vecna, its pieces scattered amidst the god's corpse, now home to monsters and perils. 
Key Aspects:
   - Ship Type: A large, magical space-faring galleon, a "spelljammer".
   - Location: Adrift in the Astral Sea, specifically within the corpse of the dead god Havok.
   - Condition: Shattered into three main pieces (sterncastle, starboard section, prow) by the catastrophic impact, with parts lodged in the god's anatomy.
   - Crew: 
     - Inda Malayuri: captain
     - Figaro: first mate (locked himself in captain's cabin)
     - Illren: second mate, acting captain, male Giff (Space Hippo - https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Giff)
     - Zastra: crew member who initially finds them, Lysan's brother, male Githyanki (https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Githyanki)
     - Lysan: crew member who initially finds them, Zastra's sister, female Githyanki (https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Githyanki)
     - Kycera: female orc
     - Daveras: male elf, druid
   - Purpose in Adventure: Serves as a multi-layered dungeon crawl, a dangerous environment where players navigate wreckage, fight astral predators, and seek the next Rod of Seven Parts fragment.
   - History: Transporting passengers between planes when it encountered Vecna's destruction, leading to its demise and the scattering of its crew.
   - Visuals: Described as chaotic, with golden sails, glowing cosmic energy, and remnants of immense divine flesh. 

  In essence, the Lambent Zenith is a dynamic, multi-part shipwreck environment that players must explore to advance their quest against Vecna.
