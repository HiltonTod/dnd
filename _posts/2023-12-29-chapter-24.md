It's early evening when the group makes it back to the Iron Vulture and settles into
the common area below deck to discuss their next move. Only a few minutes passes before
Dolor hears scratching on the outside of the hull, close to one of the small round windows.
Peering out the glass, Dolor sees Rightside hanging off the side of the ship, his claws
digging into the sill surrounding the window. "I heard some news. Can...umm...can I come
in...now, please?"

After Rightside scrambles through the porthole into the ship's common area, Dolor
chastises him. "Next time, walk up the gang plank like everyone else. A dry
[tabaxi](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Tabaxi_(5e_Race_Variant)) makes less of a ruckus
than a drenching wet one who's fallen from the side of a ship into the harbor water."

"Oh, oh, hide in plain sight! Great idea!"

Mond looks kindly at Rightside, "it's good to see you, friend. What have you heard?"

"A ship came into the harbor yesterday and docked close to that warehouse of Dalamar's
you're interested in. Yes, yes, ships do that all the time, but this is
different. Not many ships coming and going the last few days, right. Have you heard of
the big storm out in the sea? It's keeping the ships from getting in or out of Elesemar's
bay, and I mean all the ships...except for this one! People are talking. How were they
able to get through storms that no other captains can, experienced captains, mind you?
Something's up."

Suddenly, Rightside's eyes dart to a small shiny piece of brass reflecting
the lamp light and he goes quiet for a moment while fixated on the glimmering metal.

Slowly continuing his tale, "I got close enough to hear some of the workers at the
warehouse say that they'll unload it at 10 PM tonight, after things settle down on the
dock and streets."

"That's good information, and timely too. Thank you, Rightside," says Dolor.

With some discussion, the group decides to watch the ship unload later that night from
the cover and supposed comfort of Weigh Anchor, a dive bar across the street with a
decent view of the ship and the warehouse. Mond will remain at the Iron Vulture, watching
from the crow's nest with a broader view of the ship, harbor, warehouse, and streets.

Realizing that they're slightly cleaner than the usual patron at Weigh Anchor, the
group is discussing how to dirty themselves up a bit when Cap'n Don pokes his head up
from the underbelly of the ship. He's covered in charcoal colored grease and grime,
"Oy, that damnable peice o' machinery!" Finding himself facing the surprised adventurers,
"any of ya able to swing a big ol' hammer?"

With a smirk on her face, Gven stands up from a stool and makes her way over to the
hatch. The Cap'n smiles, "Aye, ye'll do fine, I'm sure o' it!"

The rest of the group follows Gven down the hatch, into the confines of the ship's inner
sanctum. They see all sorts of gadgets, gears, and knobs; things they've never seen on
a sailing vessel before. Mond, in particular, is fascinated by what he sees, mumbling to
himself as he traces pipes to fixtures and guages to knobs.

Cap'n Don hands Gven a large hammer, larger than most full-grown humans could lift with
one hand, and points at a metal pipe. "Right there, giver 'er a good ol' smackering!" Gven
lifts the long-handled hammer with both hands, swings back as far as she's able, given the
limited space in the hold, and smacks the shit out of the pipe right where the captain told
her to. "Again!" Another solid hit. "Hmm, one more oughta do it." With a slight grunt,
Gven gives the pipe one more solid smack with the big hammer. They hear a loud "ka-thunk,"
which is only a second's warning before the confined room is suddenly filled with thick,
dark fumes from an exhaust pipe somewhere in the mix of machinery.

As the dust settles, Cap'n Don excitedly yells—because he's pretty hard of hearing at this
point in the repair process—to anyone who will listen, "that's it! Ye did it, ye wonderful
ship fix'r!" The group looks at each other and realizes they are now sufficiently dirty
for a camoflauged visit to the Weigh Anchor.
