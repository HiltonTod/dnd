The adventurers leave The Gilded Glyph, everyone with a satisfied smile from the well-spent gold
coins. Their newly acquired magical gear infuses them with confidence to face the unknown perils
of a foreign plane. Having traveled through various regions of Elsemar, they're accustomed to
adapting to unknown cultures and behaviors. Fortunately, arcane and clerical magic is widely
accepted in these lands, allowing them a freedom none of them have ever experienced before.

Continuing through the city of Neverwinter, they make their way to the ironically named Neverdeath
Graveyard. Two guards stand at the gate as they approach and Gven comments, "Keeping things in or
out?"

"A wee bit o' both, ye might say. How might we 'elp ya? Aldo, ye don't look like ye need much in
da way o' help."

Dolor moves to the front. "We're looking for some folks who went inside and never made it back out.
Any thoughts on where they might be or where we might start looking?"

The other guard points to a large mausoleum up a small hill and not too far from the gate. "That
one there has been of particular interest lately. Can't tell ya who's gone in or what they were
about, but we've seen fewer come out than went in."

Dolor nods his gratitude and the group enters the Neverdeath Graveyard. The ground is covered with
dead grass and weeds. There are barely any headstones and the ones they see are tilted or broken
with most of the engravings worn beyond legibility. Off in the distance, they can see a short stone
wall that separates the cemetery. It's waist-high for a human and beyond it are large, elaborately
decorated headstones and mausoleums, most with fresh flowers laid on or arond them in remembrance
of those who have passed on. They must have entered through the gate to the pauper's graveyard, with
the stone wall protecting the deceased nobles of Neverwinter from the less fortunate, even in death.

The mausoleum that the guard pointed them towards turns out to be a squat, unassuming granite block
with metal double doors that are a few steps lower than the ground. A rusty chain hangs from the door
handles, but it's broken in one spot and failing at its task to prevent intruders. Above the door,
they can make out two words chiseled into the stone: Hallix Mausoleum.

Bilwin opens the doors and they swing easily, although noisily, with a loud creaking sound. Entering
the darkness, the dwarf sees footprints in the dust and dirt covering the floor. They lead towards
the back of the room where stairs descend into darkness. On each side of the room are three stone 
coffins. Dolor notices the dust is disturbed around the coffins and their lids, as though they've
recently been opened.

Curious, Grindlefoot walks from one coffin to the next, knocking on them with his staff, trying to
see if they're empty. The thumps reverberate through the room and beyond, down into the unexplored
crypt. Dolor has moved closer to the back stairway, "They know we're here now."

The halfling farmer gives Dolor a sheepish look, "But I didn't throw any rocks."

They hear shuffling and moans coming from the darkness of the stairs, obviously ascending towards
the group. "Ready yourselves," says the tiefling as he draws Gleaming Blade.
