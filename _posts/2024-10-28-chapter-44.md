Having dealt with the last cleric down below, Bilwin turns to the rocky area surrounding him
and looks for the archer. "Come out, ya damned cowards!" Nothing but silence in response.

On the other side of the clearing, at the top, Gven and Dolor search for the other archer with no luck.
Using her [eagle eyesight](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior#toc2), the barbarian
sees nothing except for barren rock all the way to the treeline they left yesterday. It's as
though the archers vanished into nothingness.

Down in the clearing, Mond investigates the cleric whose clothes are not charred from fire.
The robes are very well made, yet purposely without any adornment at all. They don't carry any
coins or personal objects, only a small, plain-handled dagger that is also well crafted. The
sorcerer wonders for a moment if there's more to this group than meets the eye. Thinking of
their next encounter with any zealots, he decides that a little camouflage might go a long way
to not being their target. He removes the least harmed cowl, which only has a few minor singe
marks on a cuff, and pulls it over his own robes. It might stand hard scrutiny, but should work
in passing.

Grindlefoot is still invisible and decides to investigate further up the trail. He walks into
the canyon the zealots exited from and only twenty feet later comes to another decent-sized
clearing. It contains a makeshift camp with a few tents, an unlit campfire, and some supplies
strewn about. "Come out, come out, if you can." He waits for someone to poke their head out from
a tent, but no one does and he begins searching the campsite. The tents are sparse on the inside,
holding cots and supplies, but not much else. Amongst the provisions—only a few days worth remain,
not nearly enough to return to the port city—he finds medallions with the same symbol burned into
the shrine outside the small village and shown to them by the god, Zimon.
