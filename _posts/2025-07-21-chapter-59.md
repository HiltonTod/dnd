Peering into the immense hall from the door that Bilwin abruptly opened, the dwarf and Dolor see
the caged elf hanging from the ceiling in the center of the hall. Six robed figures stand around the
poor captive, sweating from the sustained efforts of their spellcasting.

From the northwest corner of the northern wall, the doorway allows them a clear view of the entire
chamber. It opens onto a balcony that spans the eighty foot width of the room, extends forty feet from
the west wall into the room, and two stairwells on either side descend fifteen feet to the lower floor
in the middle of the room, where the captive hangs. Another balcony abuts the eastern wall, almost
two hundred feet from its opposite, and can be accessed from the lower floor with stairs on each side.

Standing at the edge of the balcony, a robed human intently watches the ceremony below him, apparently
the group's leader. Hovering behind the man in a protective manner are five one-eyed creatures, exactly
like the one they encountered only minutes ago.

Suddenly, the captive elf screams, "Get out of my head! Get out! You can't have my secrets!"

A one-eyed creature scans the room and sees the two companions; it immediately moves towards them with
obviously harmful intentions.

<!-- Round 1 -->

Bilwin sees the monster approaching and instinctively responds by casting
[Invisibility](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619116-invisibility)
on himself and Dolor, as well as Gven and Mond, who are standing behind the tiefling. Doing his
best to get out of the creature's path, the dwarven bard quietly moves toward the stairs that
lead down to the lower floor and the robed magic-users. The barbarian and sorcerer can suddenly
see into the room and understand that it's most likely something Bilwin did, purposely or not.

Dolor realizes that he's suddenly invisible, but knows that they've been discovered and closes
on the leader with Gleaming Blade. Catching the magic-user off guard, the tiefling's short sword
slices through the man's robes and leaves a trail of blood behind it. Dolor immediately becomes
visible to everyone. As the robed man grunts in agony and surprise, Dolor deftly retrieves a
healing potion from his belt with his other hand and swigs it, instantly feeling the much needed
healing effects. 

Whispering to herself, "Here we go again," Gven moves towards the leader, invokes her
[barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/),
and swiftly pulls Tempest Edge from its sheath. Still invisible, the cult leader doesn't expect
her attack and is, once again, completely surprised by the blade of her greatsword cutting through
his flesh. Presuming this is the leader and will attack them with all his power, she summons Tempest
Edge's innate magic and a bolt of lightning streaks through the blue-tinted sword into the cultist.
His body convulses from the unexpected energy and she takes further advantage of his state with
another swing of Tempest Edge that carves into his side.

Realizing that he's suddenly under attack and nont in a good position to retaliate, the leader dissolves
into [a mist](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619133-misty-step). Seconds later he reappears on
the balcony at the other end of the room, momentarily safe from the swords of Dolor and Gven.
He looks deeply into Gven's eyes, seemingly removing the physical distance between them, and whispers
"[Defend me](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619148-dominate-person)!" The barbarian considers the
command for a mere second before embracing the rage inside her. "Fuck you, wizard."

Grindlefoot enters the room, taking in the scene around him before deciding his next course of action.

Now that Dolor and Gven are visible, the five one-eyed creatures impassionately descend on them. The
first two reach out with their clawed hands and miss the tiefling and half-orc. The third monster
stares at Dolor and the rogue feels some of his life force draining away. The two remaining brutes
double-team Gven, but only one's claws connect with her shoulder and her enchanted coat protects her
from most of the harm.

Having moved closer to the center of the room, Mond loses his invisibility after a
[bolt of lightning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618999-lightning-bolt) shoots from his extended
hand, striking the leader on the other side of the room. He's knocked back slightly, but appears to
have limited the damage somehow.

Seeing the chanting cultists persecuting the imprisoned elf, Grindlefoot's anger rises and his only
thought is, "How dare they treat anyone that way!" Suddenly the the stone floor below the six sorcerers
[erupts into pieces](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2380-erupting-earth) that fly through the air.
Two of the robed figures are catapulted into the air, disrupting the joint spellcasting.

No longer ensorcelled, the caged elf regains his independent thought, reaches through the bars on the
bottom of the prison, and undoes the latch. A hinged door suddenly swings open and the elf falls to the
floor, obviously fatigued and in pain, but adeptly lands on his feet.

On the other side of the chamber, the leader suddenly looks fearful. "No! No! You don't understand
what you've done!"

Everyone can feel the energy in the room shift; the air goes still and it's eerily quiet. A purple-tinted
wave of energy begins to rip through the room in an unrecognizable pattern and then everything goes dark.
