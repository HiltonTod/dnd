_For brevity's sake, the narrator has left out much of the dialog and banter, although it was
quite entertaining in the moments._

The adventurers return to the Broken Spy Glass and are soon joined by Rightside,
who has discovered that Davanor is an interesting character. He's referred to as
a damian, someone who can get you whatever you want...using whatever means are
necessary. They're usually creative and innovative in their methods, as well
as unsavory and amoral. From his time in the city, Dolor knows that damians are
people to stay away from, which both Rightside and Tella confirm.

Mond reveals the etymology of _damian_, that it means _blood_ in the Old Language.
They surmise that's why the woman asked for a sample of their blood, their soul
and personhood is the collateral for any failures.

The door to the tavern slams open and five individuals walk in, one of whom is
a dwarf that immediately spies Rightside and heads towards him. "We'd like a word
with ye outside. Now." Bilwin tries to defuse the suddenly very tense situation
by offering the newcomers beer, on his tab. When they ignore him and refuse to
drink with him, Bilwin becomes irrationally upset and yells "How dare ya insult
[Hanseath](https://www.thievesguild.cc/gods/god?godid=240), ya fowl demons of
sobriety!" The dwarf calmly shrugs his shoulders and looks over at Tella, "we
tried to do this outside."

Fight choreography:

<!-- Round 1 -->
*   Bilwin swings his [hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy) at
    the dwarf, but it's deflected by his scale mail and a swipe of his shield.
    *   Bilwin casts [Spiritual Weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spiritual-weapon),
        and a glowing orb appears off to his side that immediately attacks and
        misses the opposing dwarf.
*   Grindlefoot slams down his beer in anger at being so rudely interrupted and
    stands up, casting [Thunderwave](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thunderwave)
    that pushes the table and benches several feet away from the group, clearing
    the area for battle. In the opposing group, a human and elf remain in place,
    but take 8 damage. The dwarf, a half-orc, and another human are pushed backwards
    and take 17 damage.

    causing 12 thunder damage.
*   Elf fires an arrow at Monda and misses, then swigs a healing potion.
*   Human 1 attacks Grindlefoot with their longsword and misses, twice.
*   Half-orc attacks Bilwin with a warhammer, connecting for 6 damage.
*   Dwarf atacks Bilwin with their warhammer and misses, but then glowers
    at Bilwin and seems to be drawing in strength of some sort.
*   Human 2 attacks Gven with a greatsword and misses, the swigs a healing potion.
*   Dolor attacks the half-orc with Gleaming Blad, causing 14 damage.
    *   Following up his shortsword, Dolor misses.

    and swings at the half-orc, just missing.
*   Rightside hides underneath a table close by.

<!-- Round 2 -->
*   Bilwin blesses the rest of the party (roll a d4 that adds to hit for each attack roll)
    *   The Spiritual Weapon attacks the opposing dwarf, causing 4 damage
*   Grindlefoot casts [Invisibility](dndbeyond.com/spells/invisibility)
    on Rightside and tells him to meet the group at the Hall of Records in 6 hours.
*   Mond casts the cantrip, [Blade Ward](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:blade-ward), to
    protect himself from weapon attacks.
    *   He then casts [Shadow Blade](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shadow-blade), and an
        ethereal sword extends from his hand, with which he then attacks and misses the half-orc.
*   Half-orc glares at Gven with the hatred of betrayal before attacking and missing her
    with its warhammer.
*   Human 1 attacks Gven with their longsword, hitting for 2 damage.
*   Dwarf hits Bilwin with its warhammer, causing 3 damage.
*   Elf fires an arrow at Mond and misses.
*   Human 2 swings their greatsword at Gven and connects for 4 damage.
*   Dolor directs a great swing of Gleaming Blade at the half-orc, connecting
    and killing it.
    *   Dolor then swings his shortsword at the dwarf, causing 5 damage.
*   Gven attacks human 2 with her greatsword, connecting for 15 damage.
*   _The group of five that entered the bar is looking pretty hagard._

<!-- Round 3 -->
*   Bilwin smacks the other dwarf across the head with his hurdy-gurdy and misses.
    *   The Spiritual Weapon misses the dwarf.
*   Grindlefoot casts [Shillelagh](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shillelagh) at
    the dwarf, causing 7 damage.
*   Mond casts [Fire Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fire-bolt) at the elf
    and misses.
    *   Following up with his shadow blade, he misses the elf.
*   Human 1 attacks Dolor with their longsword, causing 10 slashing damage.
*   Dwarf gruffly says "I'll drink when I'm thirsty!" and swings his warhammer
    at Bilwin, connecting for 9 bludgeon damage.
*   Elf fires another arrow at Mond and misses.
*   Human 2 swings its greatsword at Gven, connecting for 5 damage.
*   Dolor attacks human 1 with Gleaming Blade for 12 damage, who is also blinded
    by the magical blade.
    *   Following up with his shortsword, Dolor kills human 1.
*   Gven swings her greatsword at human 2 for 11 damage.

<!-- Round 4 -->
*   Bilwin, in his fury, casts [Guiding Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/guiding-bolt)
    with [divine inspiration](https://www.5esrd.com/database/classoption/divine-inspiration/)
    at the opposing dwarf, causing 9 damage—and he's now glowing.
    *   The Spiritual Weapon attacks the dwarf for 7 damage.

    dwarf, causing 19 damage and killing him.
*   Elf disengages and yells at human 2, "let's go!" as they run towards the door.
*   Human 2 disengages and follows the elf.
*   Dolor narrowly misses human 2 with Gleaming Blade and then connects with his
    shortsword for 7 damage, killing them.
*   Gven dashes towards the elf, tackling them before they can exit the tavern.

*   Bilwin, still enraged that the others refused to drink his beer, attacks the
    elf with his hurdy-gurdy, causing 7 damage.
    *   The Spiritual Weapon follows suit, attacking the elf for 10 damage.
*   Grindlefoot understands that Gven captured the elf to get information, brings
    her a length of rope to tie them up.
*   Suddenly, a crossbow bolt slams into the elf's chest, dropping them to the tavern
    floor, lifeless.

Turning to the source of the bolt, the group sees Tella standing at the bar and he
screams, "fuck all of y'all! Do you know what you've done? Of course not, you bumbling
nitwits! Everyone sit down, don't move, and listen. Now!"
