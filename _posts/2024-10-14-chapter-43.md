The group prepares for the night's rest after their campfire dinner and conversation.

"Why, Bilwin, my fine friend, what might that be lying next to your bedroll? The case looks
worse for wear, but it's what's inside that my curiosity needs to know."

"This," the dwarf moves the case so he can open it and tenderly removes his beloved
instrument, "is my trusty [hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy). 
It's gone with me through thick and thin, underground and above, in the air and on
the seas." There's a glimmer in his eye, "I'll take first watch for the night." He
begins to play softly.

Gustaf smiles, crawls into his bedroll, puts a black mask over his eyes, puffs of cotton into
his ears, and pulls the covers up to his neck.

Dolor is crawling into his own bedroll and looks at Gustaf then Bilwin. "I don't think those
cotton balls are going to stop the noise, but not a bad idea. I'll take the second watch."

The rest of the adventurers settle in for the first part of the night. Everyone is
surprised to hear a slow-paced and hopeful tune emerge from Bilwin's instrument. The
wistful melody permeates the area around them, causing each of them to smile for some
triggered memory or thought. Off in the distance, unknown to the group, a large predator
wakes from its day of rest, ready to begin the night's hunt—until it hears the soothing
sounds of the dwarf's melody, and decides that its prey can wait a little longer.

Long rest....

---

With the last watch, Grindlefoot wakes the others with the smell of breakfast cooking
over the rekindled campfire. Gustaf is the last to wake, but the first to speak. "Hmmm,
that smells delicious!"

"I didn't have to venture far to find some eggs, mushrooms, and berries to make omelettes.
I did hear some rustling off in the bushes that sounded like something awfully large,
but it also sounded like it yawned. Oh well, dig in."

After a short breakfast, they break camp and continue towards the mountain temple. Dolor
leads the way, with Bilwin and Gustaf trailing behind him discussing the different
geology and rock formations along their path. Mond and Grindlefoot walk in silence
behind the dwarf and archaeologist, while Gven keeps watch to the rear.

Several hours pass without any concerns as the terrain continues to change. There are fewer
trees, shrubs, and vegetation, and the land becomes more rocky and barren. The path leads
them into narrow canyons that gradully become deeper, the tops reaching twenty feet above
the ground.

Dolor exits one of the canyons, entering into a small clearing, when an arrow plunks into
the ground at his feet. "Far enough, what brings you here?"

Standing next to the arrow, Dolor looks around and sees no one on the ledges above the
clearing. "My own business. Let us pass and you'll have no trouble."

From a canyon on the other side of the clearing, a tall, muscular human man walks slowly
into the open space. He's wearing plate armor and a greatsword in a scabbard at his side.
A few smaller soldiers follow behind him, eyeing Dolor and looking confident in their odds
of three to one.

"Who do you serve?"

Before answering, the tiefling sighs and rests his hand on Gleaming Blade's pommel. "No one."

The brawny warrior across the way draws his sword and begins walking towards Dolor. "We 
serve The One!"

---

During their trek through the canyons, Gven has dropped back from the group to keep a lookout
behind them, making sure no one sneaks up and catches them unaware. While making her way quietly,
she hears the exchange between Dolor and the other man up ahead, still unable to see them because
of the winding chasm. She slows to a stop and looks upward, seeing that the top of the canyon is
a short, simple climb.

## Fight choreography

Gven easily scrambles up the canyon wall to the right side without disturbing any rocks or alerting
the enemies to her position. Reaching the top, she slowly looks over the edge and quietly pulls herself
up, keeping herself hidden. Scanning the area, she's able to barely make out two shapes along the top
of the clearing, one on each side. They've camouflaged themselves with the terrain and are almost
impossible to see.

Just then, one of them stands up from their hiding spot, aims their bow down into the clearing, and
quickly fires off two arrows at Dolor. Only one of them hits the rogue, and he responds by invoking
[uncanny dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/12-rogue#UncannyDodge-347) to reduce the damage.
Before Gven can determine their exact location, the figure drops back down into the rocks, becoming
invisible.

Just as quickly, the figure on the other side of the chasm pops up from their cover and fires two
arrows at Mond. One of them sticks into the ground and the other clips the half-elf's shoulder, turning
him with its force. The archer quickly drops down into the seemingly barren area and becomes unseen
to Gven's eyes.

The large, muscular warrior—likely a knight in service to The One—notices Mond's robes and correctly
identifies him as a magic user. He moves to attack the sorcerer with his greatsword and accidentally
attacks Bilwin, not seeing that the short dwarf stood between them. With a look of shock, Bilwin
fends off the knight's sword with his magic stein. "How dare you attack beer, ya big brute!"

Mond reacts to the knight's attack by casting [Shield](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619019-shield)
and moving five feet backwards, out of the greatsword's reach.

Dolor swings Gleaming Blade at the knight's arm, but it slides off the plate armor as though it were
a toy. He follows up with a slice of his off-hand shortsword on the other arm, but it, too, is brushed
away with ease by the heavy armor.

Scooping up a handful of sand from the ground, Grindlefoot casts
[Fog Cloud](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618910-fog-cloud) above their heads, to obscure
the archers' view. Seeing that he might need to actually defend himself, the druid halfling
casts [Shillelagh](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2249-shillelagh) on his staff.

Suddenly, Mond's signature pink [Lightning Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618999-lightning-bolt)
erupts from his hands, streaking towards the knight and one of his soldiers, too quick for the naked eye
to follow. The soldier bursts into pink flames and within seconds turns into a pile of ash on the ground.
The knight screams out in pain from the lightning bolt, but remains standing and glaring at the sorcerer
with hatred.

Furious about having his precious stein attacked, Bilwin slides his hurdy-gurdy case off of his back
and swings it with all his might at the gigantic knight in front of him. He connects with the man's
midsection, who gives an audible "oof" and pulls his gaze from the sorcerer to the dwarf. Unexpectedly,
at least to the knight and his companion, the [Spiritual Weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon)
appears next to Bilwin. The spectral floating hurdy-gurdy attacks the knight, but misses.

The other soldier moves closer to the knight and yells, "Lord Elzibar!" Then attacks Dolor with their
shortsword, missing widely in their zealous outrage.

<!-- Round 2 -->

<!-- Step-by-step
* Gven - Suddenly surrounded by fog, "Fucking halfling...that was brilliant!" Runs into the fog towards
  the last spot she thought she saw the archer, ready to attack. "Come to me, I am The One."
* Archer 1 - From within the fog, "Blasphemy!" and an arrow flies by Gven's head while another slices
  through her arm, drawing blood.
* Archer 2 - Fires two arrows at Mond, both miss.
* Knight - Really mad at Bilwin, who still stands between him and Mond. Swings his greatsword at the
  dwarf, missing the first time and connecting solidly on the second, for 13 damage.
* Dolor - Attacks the soldier closest to Grindlefoot with Gleaming Blade, for 20 damage and he drops.
  * Off-hand attack at the knight misses.
* Grindlefoot - Swings his shillelagh staff at the knight and misses, but connects on the backswing
  with his arm against the warrior's shin for 4 damage. And the halfling has a very sore arm now.
* Mond - Casts [Lightning Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618999-lightning-bolt)
  at the knight, for 27 points damage, who is looking worse for wear. Then he runs ahead into the fog,
  towards where the knight and soldiers came from.
* Bilwin - "Thank you, Hanseath" and blesses everyone in the party, giving them 1d4 on attack and saving throws.
-->

Finding herself suddenly surrounded by an impenetrable fog, Gven mutters under her breath, "Fucking
halfling...brilliant!" She runs into the fog towards the last spot she saw the archer duck down for
cover, hand on her greatsword's pommel. Loud enough for them to hear, "Come to me, for I am The One."

"Blasphemy!" echoes from an indeterminable direction in the fog, followed closely by an arrow that
flies by Gven's head. Mere moments later, a second arrow slices through her arm, drawing blood and a
grimace of pain.

On the opposite side of the chasm, another archer fires two arrows at Mond, both missing the sorcerer
and plunking into the ground at his feet. 

In the clearing, the knight glares at Bilwin, who still stands between him and his target, Mond.
His fury is evident in the clumsy swing of his weapon as it misses the short dwarf by a wide margin.
"I'm down here, you big oaf!" With a look of fury, his backswing slices through part of Bilwin's
leather armor, leaving a gash in the dwarf's forearm. "Better aim, but you're still mean and I don't
like you very much!"

Standing close to Grindlefoot, Dolor thrusts Gleaming Blade into the soldier's side, clear to the
magical blade's hilt. As the corpse slowly falls to the ground and Gleaming Blade slides free, the
tielfling gracefully twists to his other side and in the same motion slices the knight with his
off-hand shortsword, but the plate armor deflects the blade.

Grindlefoot swings his shillelagh staff at the knight and misses. Seeing an opportunity, the halfling
reverses the motion and slams his elbow into the knight's armored shin, causing him to grunt in some
small amount of pain—or perhaps acknowledgement. Grindlefoot feels his arm start to go slightly numb.
"Ouch, that's plate armor! What am I doing?"

Returning the knight's hate-filled glare, Mond calmly raises his hands and, again, casts
[Lightning Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618999-lightning-bolt). The pink lightning
shoots out across the ten feet separating them and envelopes the warrior encased in
metal armor, causing him to arch backwards and scream out in pain. Seeing an opportunity to put
more distance between himself and the angry knight, Mond runs ahead into the fog, towards where
the knight and soldiers entered the clearing.

Seeing a moment of respite from the knight's enmity, as he writhes in pain from Mond's attack,
Bilwin makes a few motions with his hands and bow's his head for a brief moment. "Thank you, Hanseath."
Suddenly, everyone in the party feels slightly more energized, as though they've been blessed by
Bilwin's prayer.
