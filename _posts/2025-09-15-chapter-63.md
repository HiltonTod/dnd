"Excuse me, your brother? We need further conversation, but now is not the time." Gesturing to his mother's
casket, "We have other priorities. Besides, you're all fresh from battle and I'm sure would like sustenance
and rest. You can stay here if you wish, as my guests."

The five adventurers nod their heads in agreement to the offer, while Elden expresses his desire to return
to his own home.

"Of course, Professor Keyward, my driver shall escort you home. For the rest of you, my staff will show you
to your rooms, where you'll find warm baths, food, and drink. Until the morrow." With a flourish of his hand,
a servant ushers them through the mansion and to their rooms.

Each of their spacious rooms consists of a bathing area, sitting nook—complete with shelves full of books—and
a large boudoir. The rooms are lavishly adorned with decorative vases, ornately carved furniture, elaborate
oil paintings of various people and scenes, and thick, soft carpeting. Grindlefoot found himself walking barefoot
around his suite, digging his toes into the luscious rug and enjoying the velvety sensation.

The companions sleep well through the night with dreams that are peaceful, yet have a hint of oddness.

Gven dreams of her childhood with her brother, Torp, and how protective and thoughtful he was; she cannot
understand how or why he has changed.

Mond and Dolor see the monsters of Shadowfell that they've fought, but from the creatures'
perspective; each wakes pondering the journeys we all take.

Bilwin returns to the market in Evernight to taste Sangora's fermented sanguinary and feels slightly tipsy
when he wakes. 

Grindlefoot dreams of Newmy and her quest to clean the Dolindar's crypt, hoping that she enjoys her labors in
the afterlife.

By the time they wake, the sun has been up for hours, yet Lord Neverwinter welcomes them to a splendid
breakfast in one of the smaller dining rooms.

"Please, sit and enjoy breaking your fast with me. Unfortunately, my day is busy and I have many questions
for you, so we must also use this time to talk."

The nobleman begins with thanking them for their services and offering them a significant reward. They are
deemed honorary citizens of Neverwinter, allowing them unrestricted passage throughout the town and region,
along with the respect of the community. He tells them that in each of their rooms is a bag of 1,800 gold
coins, something to tide them over during their stay. Lastly, his staff places a small silver platter with
a deed of trust in front of each adventurer.

"I realize that Neverwinter is not your home and that likely burns at the peacefulness in your souls. But,
while you must reside in our fair city, I assure you that you will have comfortable accomodations. These five
properties are in the Bluelake District, not terribly far from here, and each has a lovely house which you
are welcome to call home, for as long as you like. Make no mistake, you own them and may do as you will. We
are grateful for your service."

"Now, my barbarian friend, tell me more of your brother."

Gven sighs heavily, unwilling to trust this stranger, yet understanding that their stories seem intertwined.
She proceeds to tell their tale.

What feels like years of adventuring side by side and building the bonds
of friendship, has only been a few months. How she and her brother, Torp, grew up in the grassy plains of
The Badlands of Eritz with the Sky Bisons tribe. How Torp left for his
Coming Out journey—to see the world and find his path—but never returned. How she questioned his whereabouts
and fate, eventually embarking on
her Coming Out, with the goal of finding him. How she met Dolor, Grindlefoot, and Xantic on the Ha-derech.
How they became known as Chimera's Bane while fighting off an oppresive hill giant's goblin army in the
small town of Wayside. How Mond and Bilwin joined their group in Wayside, while Xantic chose a different path
forward. How her brother finally found her in Elsemar, but he was someone she
didn't recognize; the leader of a cult and crime organization, going by the name Davanor. How they sailed to
Amonah in search of answers, only to find more questions about a god named Aish and to be suddenly transported
to Neverwinter.

"Alas, that is a story of hardy friendships, overcoming trials, and making great discoveries. I will make
certain the names of Davanor and Aish are circulated amongst my networks. If we hear anything, I'll relay
the information to you, no matter how trivial. And remember, Gven, we are not our sibling's keepers."
