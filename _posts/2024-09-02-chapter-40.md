With the zombie [tyrannosaurus rex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17041-tyrannosaurus-rex)
turned to dust and the [yellow musk creepers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Yellow_musk_creeper)
slashed to pieces, Nyx turns to the adventurers.

"Looks like my job here is done. Watch out for those yellow creeper flowers, they'll be on
you before you know it." 

Gven asks, "Before you leave, can you tell us how you came to roam this island?"

"I arrived here like most folks, on a boat. Despite my feline heritage, I was quite the pira, um,
sailor at one time. Like many ships on the Cracked Crystal Sea, mine ended up here. I'm quite curious,
probably because of my feline heritage, and discovered that this beautiful land in the middle of the
sea is hurting, perhaps even dying. I know what they say about this being the home of the gods,
and it probably can't die, but it sure is sick. Being a
[blood hunter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/357975-blood-hunter), my particular skillset is
quite useful when dealing with monsters of all sorts, which this island has in boat loads."

He pulls out a long knife and cuts a mark into his tabby-striped arm, alongside three others. "That
was the fourth undead T-Rex I've taken out in the year I've been here. Buggers keep not-dying, thanks
to these damned flowers."

After all this time using his [spiritual weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon)
in battle, Bilwin has finally noticed the floating hurdy-gurdy next to him. Wondering why his
instrument is floating and not in its case on his back, he reaches for it, but his hand swipes
right through the ethereal instrument. Realizing that his real hurdy-gurdy case is in his other
hand, the dwarf curses in his native tongue, "What ore-headed oaf lets their hurdy-gurdy fly about
all by itself!"

Nyx continues, "Why are you wandering around this inhospitable chunk of land?"

Dolor responds, "We're headed towards that temple on the mountain, looking for answers to questions."
With a brief glance at Bilwin, "We've been told by a...close acquaintance...that we'll find answers
there."

"I can see that you know how to handle yourselves, even if that large one," the tabaxi looks at
Gven, "is easily charmed by pretty things. That temple's a mystery. Used to be when I first discovered
it that folks would poke around it and then get back to where they came from. But not no more, now
they seem to go in and never come back out. Keep your wits about you, if you're determined to go
there."

Gven asks, "Would you be willing to guide us or help us understand what other troubles we might
encounter on the way?"

Shaking its head, "I can't guide you. My duties lie with the undead. But I can tell you this.
That mountain is dangerous, even moreso than the rest of this island. Keep your eyes and ears open,
your mouths shut, and don't play around with the carnivorous vines. They'd as soon eat ya while
that one over there," he nods at Gven again, "is smelling the damned things flowers. And keep a
look out for the bird folks. They might be friendly to ya...and then again, they might not. You
never know about birds."

Mond adds, "Valindra didn't mention anything about [aarakocra](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/4-aarakocra)
between us and the temple."

"Oy, beware that elven mage. I get a strange scent from that one."

Sliding the scimitar into its sheath, the muscular tabaxi adjusts its armor and prepares to
leave. "I'm off to find an undead lizard that lives in the seawater. According to the locals,
at least the ones who say they've seen it, it's supposed to be as big as one of these T-Rexes.
Should be an interesting encounter. Be wary." Before anyone can respond, Nyx lopes off into the
jungle.
