The group of adventurers spends a week in Wayside, resting and relaxing, gaining new friends,
listening to tales in the Buzzin Bee's common room, and learning that Preet, from the Low Elves,
is much better at telling stories than he is at playing the luteâ€”and his song lyrics and poetry
are still horrid. It's been a an enjoyable time getting to know the townsfolk and building
relationships they'll miss while on the road.

One evening in particular, Preet was entertaining a packed crowd with various tales when
someone yells out "tell us about the Uprising!" With a lengthy sigh and conspiratorial look at
the crowd, he quietly says "if that's what you'd like, but know that it's not always a welcome
subject, so be careful where and *when* ye ask for 'em." His eyes are directed at a member of
the Pride and Comfort seated in the back of the room, who is quietly scanning the crowd until
his gaze rests on Gven.

Several centuries ago, magic was common in Eritz and the rest of Olam, and magic-users were
well respected by the citizens, revered even. They made phenomenal discoveries and advances in
the mystic arts that improved the lives of all in Eritz. One wizard, Acertep, led them with
a noble mind and sincere heart, expanding their power and influence across the continent. As
it tends to do, greater power lead to greater arrogance and the magic users began to see
themselves as above the law. Who was anyone to question their benevolence or magnanimous
intentions?

Acertep continued to lead the magic users in Eritz as they mutated into an unbending and
unrelenting force for authoritarian control over all others. Along for the ride, the religious
groups allied themselves with the magic users. The clerics and paladins of the clergy would
police the populace and fight in battles alongside the magicians and wizards. The magic users
and clergy felt that they, and only them, knew what was best for the world, no one else could
contribute or lead in their stead.

For all of their power, the magic users and clergy were few in numbers when compared with
the rest of the population. Either of those paths took decades of disciplined study, earnest
practice, and focused apprenticeship.
