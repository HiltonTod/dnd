It's early evening when the group makes it back to the Iron Vulture and settles into
the common area below deck to discuss their next move. Only a few minutes passes before
Dolor hears scratching on the outside of the hull, close to one of the small round windows.
Peering out the glass, Dolor sees Rightside hanging off the side of the ship, his claws
digging into the sill surrounding the window. "I heard some news. Can...umm...can I come
in...now, please?"

After Rightside scrambles through the porthole into the ship's common area, Dolor
chastises him. "Next time, walk up the gang plank like everyone else. A dry
[tabaxi](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Tabaxi_(5e_Race_Variant)) makes less of a ruckus
than a drenching wet one who's fallen from the side of a ship into the harbor water."

"Oh, oh, hide in plain sight! Great idea!"

Mond looks kindly at Rightside, "it's good to see you, friend. What have you heard?"

"A ship came into the harbor yesterday and docked close to that warehouse of Dalamar's
you're interested in. Yes, yes, ships do that all the time, but this is
different. Not many ships coming and going the last few days, right. Have you heard of
the big storm out in the sea? It's keeping the ships from getting in or out of Elesemar's
bay, and I mean all the ships...except for this one! People are talking. How were they
able to get through storms that no other captains can, experienced captains, mind you?
Something's up."

Suddenly, Rightside's eyes dart to a small shiny piece of brass reflecting
the lamp light and he goes quiet for a moment while fixated on the glimmering metal.

"I got close enough to hear some of the workers at the warehouse say that they'll unload
it at 10 PM tonight, after things settle down on the dock and streets."

"That's good information, and timely too. Thank you, Rightside," says Dolor.
