Returning to Hallix Mausoleum, the group enters the crypts, pass through the first room into the
second and turn right, carefully traversing the caved-in tunnel to the room where they finished
off the [wights](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17059-wight). On the north wall, there are two
more doors for them to investigate, one to each side of the room where they discovered Sarcelle
Malinosh. At the west wall, a short set of stairs leads up to a landing and the closed door with a
large painted eye. In the southern wall, another caved-in tunnel leads into darkness, next to a
pile of stone rubble in the southeastern corner.

"Shall we see what lies in these other doors, next to the sorceress's prison cell?" Dolor opens
the unlocked door to the left of the cell and moves forward cautiously. It seems to be a storage room,
filled with all sorts of supplies. Crates, boxes, and large bags are stacked against one of the walls.
On two other walls are shelves containing lanterns, dry food stuff, casks of water, manacles, chains,
and more.

Two flasks catch the tiefling's eye and upon closer inspection, they both have "take to feel better"
scrawled across their fronts. Suspicious of their surroundings, Gven suggests Bilwin verify
they're healing potions and not something nefarious. Accepting the flask from Dolor, the cleric
removes the stopper, takes a sniff and casts [Detect Magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619097-detect-magic).

"Oh no, these aren't going to help anyone who drinks them. Quite the opposite, really." He moves
to put them back on the shelf, but Gven suggests they might come in handy sometime.

"Indeed, they might." And he puts them into a special pocket within his
[Bag of Holding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4581-bag-of-holding).

Dolor moves to the door to the right of Sarcelle's room and opens the unlocked door to find a small
room, ten feet along each wall. It's dominated by a large iron grate in the center, easily five
feet across each way. Moving close to the grate, Gven bends down to investigate and sees that it
covers a shallow pit holding a golden harp, sheaf of papers, and piece of cloth that appears
to be saturated in blood.

Before reaching through the grate's five inch wide openings, she studies the iron enclosure more
closely. The half-orc notices blades inset around the edges of the stone encasing it. Pressing
ever-so-lightly on the grate, the blades begin to move inward—a trap for anyone who attempts to
reach through and grab the items below.

Dolor retrieves a crow bar from his backpack and attempts to use it as lever to open the grate, but
it's too heavy. Giving Gven a look, she takes the crowbar, wedges it into the narrow opening between
the grate and the stone's edge, then pushes down with all her strength. Her neck and arm muscles
bulge in effort for several seconds before the edge of the grate gives, folding upward and making
a larger opening.

"I got this!" Bilwin inches closer and a [spectral hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2173-mage-hand)
appears next to him. The dwarf's concentration is obvious as he moves the floating hand through the
opening created by the crowbar and retrieves each of the objects.

Mond takes the cloth from the magical hand and discovers that it's a torn edge, likely from a cloak or
coat. It's completely saturated by dried blood.

Dolor examines the harp, even playing a few chords with some sense of aptitude, to find that it's a
finely made, yet unenchanted harp.

The ethereal hand brings the papers to Bilwin, who begins to shuffle through them. "This one looks
like a map of a large estate and this one is a schedule, including locations, times, and events.
What's this scribbled in the margins?" He turns the paper slightly, so he can read the handwritten
words. "'Her secrets will make a worthy sacrifice.' What's that mean? Oh, here's a name written on
one of the pages: Indrina Lamsensettle. That's the actor Lord Neverember wants us to find, right?"
