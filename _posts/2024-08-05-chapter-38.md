Slowly falling to the tree-covered jungle in the gorge, Dolor considers the irony of being
an agile thief and the only one that fell from the rope. Even that muscle-bound half-orc,
Gven, nimbly scurried across the thin line. Thanks to
[Asmodeus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Asmodeus), Bilwin had the wherewithal
to cast [Feather Fall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2095-feather-fall) so he won't be
hurt, assuming he doesn't land in a spot of quicksand or get skewered by some knife-shaped
tropical tree trunk.

Reaching the canopy of trees, the tiefling is able to navigate the leaves and branches,
landing softly on the jungle floor. It's oddly quiet here, much more so than up top along
the ancient roadway. There are a few unique sounds he can pick out, probably different
types of animals live in the gorge. One in particular, a low ribbit, seems prominent
amongst the cacophony and coming from all directions.

Noticing that the croaking sounds are getting closer, Dolor rests his hand on Gleaming
Blade and stands still but alert with his sword in its scabbard. Within a few minutes,
five small-statured [froglike humanoids](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage:grung) appear
from the surrounding jungle and surround Dolor.

"Hello, I'm new to this part of the island and looking for a way back up to the
top of the gorge. You wouldn't be able to point in the right direction for a stairway
or the like?" The creatures stare at him and continue to talk amongst themselves in the
rumbling ribbits. Four of them have green skin, while the one doing most of the talking
is red. They aren't wearing clothing of any sort, which makes it easy for Dolor to see
that their skin glimmers with a thin covering of moisture. They begin to fan out around
him.

"Looks like we're going to do this the old fashioned way, eh."

At the top of the ravine, Gven volunteers to rappel down into the gorge and look for
Dolor. Grindlefoot takes two lengths of rope tied together and secures one end to a
sturdy-looking tree stump. He yanks on it a few times, "There, I think that will hold.
At least, it should."
