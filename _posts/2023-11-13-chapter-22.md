After wrapping up with the city guard at Waffle Wizards, the group walks over
to Dolly's Donuts to give them the news. Dolly and her crew are happy to have
things get back to normal and Fred, the chef, reveals his latest baked creation.
"I call this a lunch donut." He lays a tray on the table that is full of round
pastries with holes in the middle, but the bread looks different, it glistens as
though it's been polished. Grindlefoot grabs one from the tray and seems to enjoy
the flavor. "The outside is crisp, like a crust, and the inside is much
thicker than a usual donut. Tasty!"

It's now mid-afternoon and the group heads back to the Broken Spy Glass. When they
arrive, they debrief with Tella and discover that Rightside has been following them.
A testament to his skills that they didn't notice. They lay low for the rest of
the afternoon, the previous night and this morning were eventful, to say the least.

They reconvene in the common room for dinner to find it bustling with a wide variety
of customers. Some are obviously well off, although not so much so that they don't
still prefer a good deal over flaunting their perogative. Many of them appear to be
laborers, enjoying a dinner and drink out with friends and some entertainment.
It's a calm, yet joyful and happy crowd.

After dinner, Gven tells the others, "I'm going for a stroll. Might head over to the
Job Distribution Center and have a casual look around. Looking for opportunities,
not trouble." Bilwin is eyeballing the stage, sizing up the lute player and says,
"I'm going to stay here. These fine folk deserve some real entertainment and I'm
just the lean, handsome, well-dressed dwarf to give it to them!" Mond, Dolor, and
Grindlefoot agree to walk with Gven.
