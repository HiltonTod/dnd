Behind the boar-like creature with tiny wings, there is an iron door made of thick bars that run vertically. Clearly
the creature is guarding a prison cell. They're holding a long trident, its butt resting on the stone floor and a ring
of keys hanging from the middle tine. The group stands silently, somewhat dumbfounded that their disguises are
working.

Grindlefoot looks around at the cavern and notices that the ceilings are quite high, probably twenty feet or more.
To their left as they entered, a passageway extends to the east into darkness. The creature, obviously a guard of
some sort, and the cell are on the west side of the cavern. The halfling can't see much past the large boar-headed
guard, but thinks that the cell is quite large.

While his eyes take in the room, the druid hears a chittering in the air, barely audible enough to reach his ears.
The sounds are coming from all around the room, but seem to be louder towards the passageway. Looking at the others,
Grindlefoot sees that they're focused on the guard and don't appear to hear anything. Focusing on the sounds, he
realizes they're actually words. "Eight legs. Dance in the dark. You know the dance." Looking up, into the corners
of the room, he becomes fascinated with the small webbing he discovers. He suddenly needs to touch it, to feel the
sensation of the web. And then the need is gone. The druid shakes his head softly, wondering what just happened.

Bilwin, ever the social butterfly of the group, quickly recovers, sports a large smile, and approaches the guard.

"Hail, friend! This is an amazing place you're guarding here. And that is a great trident! I don't think I've ever
seen such a nice trident. We're looking for our friends and we think they passed this way. Have you seen them?"

In their minds, the group hears the creature's response. "I'm Maltok and this trident is part of my duty, but yes,
it is a nice trident. Feels sturdy. It would work in battle. Yes, indeed, it would." Glaring at Bilwin and then
the others, "Are you here to relieve me or looking for your, um, friends?"

Gven moves forward in a menacing manner to within a few feet of the guard, who stands at the same height. Staring
into its face, eye to eye, she glowers at him. "Yes, I'm here to relieve you, because only the strongest of us
can guard this area. And I'm the strongest one I know." She tightens her fists and the muscles in her arms ripple,
visible through the taut leather sleeves of her long coat.

Returning her stare for almost ten seconds, the creature suddenly shrugs its shoulders and hands her the trident
with the key ring still looped around the middle tine.

"Good, I shall go pray." And they lumber off through the door the group entered.

"Shall we?" Gven lifts the key ring from the trident and looks to her companions. Dolor gestures towards the iron
door.
