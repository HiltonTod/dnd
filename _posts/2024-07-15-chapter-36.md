The group wakes to the sounds of the jungle coming alive. Chirps and clicks begin to erupt from
unseen birds, the guttural croak of a frog somewhere off in the distance, and the slow rythmic
buzzing of insects adds to nature's symphony. Through it all, a distant howler monkey's mournful
call hangs heavy in the humid air, a slightly haunting start to the new day.

After a brief breakfast of trail rations, they proceed towards the mountain temple in the same
order as yesterday. Dolor leads them, cutting back vines and vegetation with a machete, followed
closely by Bilwin and Mond. Grindlefoot scampers along the path as lightly as the previous day,
unhindered by the dense plant growth, and Gven continues to battle the branches that snap back
to attention after his passing.

"Hey farmer, would you mind not aiming every single twig at my face! I could keep a better eye
on our path and how to get back to the cove if I didn't have to fight the jungle too."

Grindlefoot pauses for a second and looks at Gven, only realizing in that moment that he was
causing her any discomfort at all. "Oh, you don't need to worry about getting back there, I'm
a [Wanderer](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/background:outlander#toc2). I could lead us back there
with my eyes closed." He points off in the general direction they've traveled from, then just
as quickly returns to following Mond and the others. "Isn't this jungle great! It's almost like
it wants us to walk this way by making it so easy!" Gven groans as another branch smacks her
in the face.

Around midday, after several hours of walking, they approach a large gorge, roughly 200 feet
across to the other side. Dolor turns to Bilwin, "does that map of yours show anything about
this gorge or the easiest way to get to the other side?"

"Ah, isn't that map a beautiful specimen of cartography. I could get lost in it for hours, along
with a nice tasty beer, of course. But no, it doesn't show much detail about this gorge, other
than the river at the bottom running across the island. Although, I remember from our air
reconnaissance that there's a bridge somewhere close to here. Otherwise, it's probably a day's
walk either way to get around it. I think the bridge is in that direction," and Bilwin points
towards the east.

Following Bilwin's direction and walking within the cover of the jungle, they soon catch sight
of a stone bridge that spans the gorge. A cacophony of monkeys grows louder as they get closer
to the bridge. They can now see that the bridge has statues of monkeys lining the sides every
20 or 30 feet. Surprising them, a deep laugh emanates from the gorge below them and the
monkeys quiet down momentarily, whether out of fear or respect, they're uncertain.

Approaching the bridge, they can see that an ancient road is now overgrown by the jungle
plants, only passable by the monkeys and other native animals. The bridge's stone sides are
covered in intricate carvings with geometric themes. Looking towards the other side of the
gorge, they see a large stone statue of a kneeling warrior at the halfway point. A human
skeleton rests at the base of the statue.

Off towards the west a few thousand feet away, Dolor spies a rock floating several hundred
feet above the river in the middle of the gorge. "Gven, can you make out anything with that
oddly placed rock?"

Looking toward the rock and embracing her
[totem warrior](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior)'s Eagle
[aspect of the beast](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior#toc2),
Gven is able to clearly see the floating boulder. "There's a tree living on it and the rock
appears to be a little bigger than the root ball. I don't see anything else of note, but
then...a floating rock with a tree is fairly noteworthy."

Mond speaks up, "I believe that's an [earthmote](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Earthmote).
It's held aloft by strong magic that cannot be dispelled. Hmm, could be interesting to explore
it further, when we have time, that is."

Turning back to the bridge, Dolor fires an arrow at the warrior statue to see if it triggers
any movement or spells. Nothing happens in response, so the group begins to cross.

Curious about the geometric markings on the bridge's stone railings, Bilwin investigates
them and finds references to the gods, [Moradin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Moradin)
and [Ubtao](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ubtao).

From the south side of the bridge, Dolor fires an arrow at the warrior statue to see if it
triggers any movement or spells. Nothing happens in response, so the group begins to cross.
As they approach the halfway point, about 40 feet from the statue, it suddenly stands up and
in a booming, deep voice says "You are not worthy."

Gven quickly responds with "and who are you to deem us unworthy?" She moves within striking
distance of the animated stone warrior, holding Tempest's Edge at the ready.
