The morning arrives to find the adventurers well rested, each pondering their dreams from the night—surprisingly
realistic and immsersive.

Grindlefoot dreamt of a spider weaving an intricate web that spans worlds. The spider's filaments shoot off in
every direction, seemingly without purpose. Yet, each gossamer strand represents a place the spider has been or
will be. There is purpose in the network of gossamer silk. Just as the halfling's journey has taken him across
a continent and planes of existence, the spider's web represents its complex journey. Unlike the halfling, a
spider doesn't worry about navigating its web, it trusts in its instincts. The druid takes comfort from his dream
and embraces his journey, no longer worrying quite as much about what the future holds.

The barbarian's dreams are dominated by her brother's presence, or lack thereof. Gven works best with straight
lines, direct correlations between events and results, actions and consequences. Torp's actions make no sense
to the half-orc. They had the same experiences as children, lived in the same area during their formative years,
received the love and support of their parents, but his choices are the antithesis of hers. In her dreams, she
found herself navigating the rain-soaked back alleys of a noisy and chaotic town. Wet, cold, and hungry, she
comes across a public house where she can see the warm hearth fires burning and hear the jovial voices coming
from inside. Then it becomes hazy and the half-orc is pushed back violently, "Your kind isn't welcome here!"
Upon reflection in the morning, Gven understands that those weren't her memories or even her subconscious fears.
She wonders, whose were they?
