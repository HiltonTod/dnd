As midnight approaches, the village of Wayside is prepared for the goblin horde
headed its way. Well, as preprared as they can be with only a few hours notice
and no support from the Hand of the Wand. They're relying on the skill—and luck—of
their local heroes, The Low Elves, and Chimera's Bane, a group of adventurers
who happened to be traveling the Ha-derech.

The goblin horde is approaching from the North, where there's 250 feet of open
fields between the treeline and the buildings of Wayside. The Low Elves, without
Cindel, are stationed at Scribbles & Nibs and Preva's Flowers.

At the Buzzin Bee, Cindel and Dolor are on the second floor, peering out of the
windows, ready for their first opportunity to use their bows. Gven has placed
several barrels and other smallish obstacles behind the Buzzin Bee and is crouched
behind one, keeping both eyes on the treeline and the torches illuminating the trees.
Grindlefoot has snuck into the forest and climbed a tree, quietly waiting for
goblins to unwittingly run below him, allowing him to give them a little surprise.
Unfortunately, Xantic is still out cold and in the basement at Bargain Ben's with
the townsfolk. He can be a last line of defense, if the others fail to stop the
mob of goblins.

Then it's quiet....

While waiting in the tree, Grindlefoot has a conversation with himself about what
he should [wild shape](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/635-druid-101-wild-shape-guide)
into for the coming battle. "A [giant rat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16891-giant-rat)?
[Darkvision](https://roleplayersrespite.com/darkvision-5e)
and a good sense of smell, but not very helpful with attacks. Another
[giant goat](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16885-giant-goat)?
No darkvision...and too exposed anyway.
[Giant snake](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16878-giant-constrictor-snake)
again? Hmm, that's an option, but they're kind of slow. Oh, how about a...hmmm, yes,
that could be perfect." 

Grindlefoot is so busy deciding what creature to become, that he fails to notice
the first wave of the goblin horde until they're underneath him and running past
the tree he's sitting in. Luckily, they're in a frenzied state and don't bother
to look up and see the halfling suddenly shift into a
[giant spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16895-giant-spider).

Meanwhile, at the Buzzin Bee, Gven is waiting impatiently, not paying particularly
close attention from her position behind a barrel close to the fire pit. From a
second floor window, Dolor is transfixed on another part of the treeline, when
Cindel quietly says "look alive, they're here."

Fight choreography:

**Round 1**

*   10 goblins come out from the treeline and reveal themselves, 250 feet from the Buzzin Bee.
*   Cindel takes a shot with her longbow and misses, but the arrow sticks into the
    tree where Grindlefoot is hiding, now as a giant spider.
*   4 of the 10 goblins stop at the treeline to BLABLABLA
