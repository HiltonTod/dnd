# TEMPORARY SUMMARY OF EVENTS

* Gven reconnects with her older brother, Torp, and discovers that he has become a zealot
  for one (or more?) of the old gods. He was lost at sea, saved by the gods, and brought
  to the island of Amonah. There he was taught (indoctrinated) that magic users are the
  ones who caused The Conflict, they alone are to blame.
* Torp returned to Elsemar using the disguise of Davanor, a Damian, with the goal of
  genocide—to completely eradicate magic users from Eritz.
* Davanor warns Gven and the others to leave Elsemar now, if they want to live.
* Gven and the others return to the Iron Vulture, where they realize that Cap'n Don is
  an [artificer](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/artificer) as he turns the ship into a faraday
  cage to protect them during the night.

Long rest....

* They go to the Broken Spy Glass to consult with Tella. Talk and stuf....
  * In the old tongue, "Davanor" has special meaning: "davan" is "to pray" and "or" is "to light."
    Torp took on the name as a symbol for his prayers bringing light to the world.
  * Elsemar was the seat of the clerical power in Eritz and Mirganor was the seat of arcane power.
  * Tell the harbor master that the ship is headed to the Northlands to trade, as a way
    of throwing Davanor off their trail.
* The group decides to set sail for the old, unknown island of Amonah and investigate
  where Torp learned about the gods and turned into a zealot.
  * Tella will give them supplies for their journey.
* They were viewing the holy symbol they discovered upside down. Turned 180 degrees, they
  Bilwin recognized it as the symbol for B'raq (similar to [Talos](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Talos)?).
