Leaving Grinder's Mill, the adventurers head back to Food Alley and Waffle Wizards
to find out if they have anything to do with the odd goings-ons with the newer
shops in the alley.

Along the way, they stop by Dolly's Donuts to drop off a bag of non-enchanted flour
that Grinder had given them. There's a sign on the front door that reads, "Temporarily
closed due to living donuts." Fred is excited to have flour that he can actually use.
At least they think he's excited, primarily based on the unusual half-smile.

Grindlefoot asks Dolly if she knows Corinne at Waffle Wizards. "Sure, but not very well.
She's a bit greasy, if you know what I mean."

It doesn't take them long to reach the squat stone building designed to look like a castle,
albeit a much smaller version than the real thing. The stonework, doors, and windows
appear a tad rundown, as though regular maintenance is lower on the to-do list than
other items. The sign above the door is quite large and made up of individual tiles
for each letter in the name, that come together into the shape of a waffle. WAFFLE
WIZARDS is spelled out in very large, block-style, black letters, with each one on
a bright yellow background and . If any of the group had previously been to a Waffle
Wizzard before, they would have known that these signs are an iconic sighting
throughout Eritz.

They enter through the front door and female [aarakocra](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/4-aarakocra)
with bright pink feathers greets them in a nasally, slow drone. "Welcome to Waffle
Wizards, where everything is magical. I'm Flo and I'll be helping you today, sugar.
Let's get you seated." She takes them to a table and gives a slow rundown of the
menu.

Gven notices a goblin cleaning a table with a distinct lack of effort. She walks over
to the table and plops the sack of enchanted flour on the it. "I think this is yours,"
then walks back to her group's table. The goblin rolls its eyes and starts to say
something, but then thinks otherwise and picks up the sack, lugging it to the kitchen.

Mond orders the woefuls, the one selection that Flo warned them about. After a few
bites, he suddenly gets very sad. Grindlefoot notices, "what does it taste like?"
Mond quietly says, "regret. And I have to commend the chef!" He makes his way
to the kitchen and finds a [bugbear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16817-bugbear)
wearing a hairnet flipping fried eggs on the stove top. The cook grunts in response
to Mond, not seeming to care about any accolades.

Back at the table, Gven asks Flo if Corinne is around. Flo turns towards the back
of the restaurant, "Corinne, honey, these folks want to chat with you." Turning
back to the group, "anything else I can get ya, sweeties?" The group shakes their
heads no and Flo returns to the hostess stand, leans over and props her head on
her hand to watch the ensuing confrontation.

Emerging from the kitchen, a middle-aged [tiefling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/7-tiefling)
with purple hair has a distinct look of annoyance on her face. In a slightly aggressive
yet overly sweet tone, "How can I help you?"

Dolor and Gven begin to question Corinne about Food Alley, the newer cafes, and
the morning's flour delivery. Quickly tiring of the inquisition, Corinne becomes
angry and defensive. 

"Look, those shops have no right to steal our customers!
It's all I can do to keep this place running so that Flo, Squiggy, and Chuck have
jobs." She points at Flo, the goblin, and then the bugbear as she says their names.
"Look at this place, you think I want to be here? No way! This is the first step
in my plan. After I get this place turned around, I'm going to manage a Beyond
the Wall Grill or maybe a Red Keep Bistro. The honchos up at Game of Stones
Restaurants are gonna know the name Corinne and they're going to be impressed."

As her voice gets louder and she becomes even more visibly upset, Squiggy and
Chuck come out of the kitchen to stand behind her. Flo is still at the hostess
stand, loudly chewing on a stick of gum with a look of interest on her face.
There are only two other customers in the cafe, both older and sitting together
at a two-top, sipping on their coffee and chatting as though nothing's going on.

Gven stands up from her chair and puts her hand on her greatsword and calmly says,
"so you did enchant the flour to sabotage the other shops."

A villainous look of rage crosses Corinne's face, "Chuck and Squiggy, we have
troublemakers."

Fight choreography:

<!-- Round 1 -->
*   Squiggy, the goblin, attacks Gven with a large fork, stabbing her 3 times for a total of 18 damage
    and then suddenly disappears, reappearing 20 feet away in another part of the diner.

        causing 7 damage to Gven.

    granting her 11 healing.

<!-- Round 2 -->
*   Squiggy attacks Gven with his very large fork again, hitting her 2 times for 5 damage
    and then (again) disappears and reappears 20 feet away.
*   Dolor attacks Chuck with Gleaming Blade, knocking them unconscious.
*   Grindlefoot, as a dire wolf, bites Corinne and causes 5 damage.
*   Mond is able to shake off the slowness effects and casts [mind spike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mind-spike)
    at Corinne, who takes 4 damage.
*   Gven can't break free of the slow spell, but swigs a healing potion for 14 in healing.
*   Corinne drops the slow spell and waves her arm, animating 3 tables, which begin attacking.
    *   Table 1 bashes Gven with it's legs for 6 damage.
    *   Table 2 swings at Gven and misses.
    *   Table 3 swings at Dolor and misses.
*   Bilwin attacks Squiggy with [guiding bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/guiding-bolt), but it misses.
    *   He then casts [spiritual weapon](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Spiritual%20Weapon#content)
        and attacks Squiggy, but misses again.

<!-- Round 3 -->
*   Squiggy attacks Gven with that damn fork another 4 times, missing all of them.
*   Dolor attacks Corinne with Gleaming Blade and knocks her unconscious.
    *   The animated tables suddenly stop, once again in their inanimate form.
*   Squiggy stops fighting, throws down that stupid fork and yells, "alright, alright!"

Within a few minutes, two members of the city watch burst through the front doors and
arrest Corinne, Chuck, and Squiggy. Gven tells the watch that the evidence is in the
kitchen and says they can chat with Rezko over at Grinder's Mill for more details.

Over at the two top, Flo is standing next to the couple, a male dwarf and female elf,
keeping their coffee cups filled. She looks up at Dolor, "hey sweetie, when you go
back to Dolly's, let her know that Flo is looking for a new job, will ya."

_The adventurers advance to level 5._
