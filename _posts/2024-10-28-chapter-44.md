Having dealt with the last cleric down below, Bilwin turns to the rocky area surrounding him
and looks for the archer. "Come out, ya damned cowards!" Nothing but silence in response.

On the other side of the clearing, at the top, Gven and Dolor search for the other archer with no luck.
Using her [Aspect of the Beast's Eagle](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior#toc2)
eyesight, the barbarian sees nothing except for barren rock all the way to the treeline they left
yesterday. It's as though the archers vanished into nothingness.

Down in the clearing, Mond investigates the cleric whose clothes are not charred from fire.
The robes are very well made, yet purposely without any adornment at all. They don't carry any
coins or personal objects, only a small, plain-handled dagger that is also well crafted. The
sorcerer wonders for a moment if there's more to this group than meets the eye. Thinking of
their next encounter with any zealots, he decides that a little camouflage might go a long way
to not being their target. He removes the least harmed cowl, which only has a few minor singe
marks on a cuff, and pulls it over his own robes. It might stand hard scrutiny, but should work
in passing.
