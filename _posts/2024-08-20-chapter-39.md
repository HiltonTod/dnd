The morning light arrives to find the group already awake and eager to continue their journey
to the mountain temple. Dolor leads the group, with Bilwin close behind him, then Mond,
Grindlefoot, and Gven bringing up the tail end. They battle the jungle's dense foliage and
thick vegetation for several hours, making slow progress towards their destination.

They enter a small area that has slightly less vegetation than the path they've tread. It's
not large enough to be considered a glade or even a clearing, but it's noticeable. As Dolor
enters the area, he sees several bunches of
[large yellow flowers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Yellow_musk_creeper), blossoming
from vines that are encircling the trees. He catches a whiff of their fragrances, immediately 
thinking to himself how pretty they are and that he wants to see them up closer. With a shake
of his head, his mind clears of the odd desire to smell the flowers and he continues forward.

Bilwin, Mond, and Grindlefoot also observe the lovely flowers, feel a sudden desire to
smell them up close, and then decide to continue ahead. Meanwhile, Gven is the last one to
encounter them and becomes enthralled with experiencing their beauty and holding them in her
hands. When she nears the closest one, the six flowering vines close in on the group,
surrounding them and preventing any escape.

-->

The route in front of him suddenly closes off; Dolor immediately draws Gleaming
Blade in one hand and his shortsword in the other. He attacks one of the slithering vines,
cutting off several blooming flowers and tendrils.

Responding to the assault, Mond casts [Ray of Frost](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2226-ray-of-frost)
at a vine close to him. The streaks of blue-white light crackle and vibrate through the air,
turning many of the plant's stems and leaves to brittle ice.

Meanwhile, Gven approaches the vine closest to her, about to touch it, when she's
suddenly able to shake off the enchantment and backs away. Grindlefoot turns back towards
Gven and casts [Flame Blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2106-flame-blade), quickly
slicing through many of its appendages and flowers.

Bilwin wasn't really paying that close of attention as they were walking, mostly putting
one foot in front of the other and making sure Dolor's backside was always there. He
sees Dolor draw his swords and then realizes the flowers are moving, and not in a very
amicable way. He swings his [hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy) case from
his back and smashes one of the vines with it, obviously causing a bit of pain, because the
vine flinched. He then casts [Spiritual Weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon)
and his usual spectral companion in battle, a glowing beer stein, appears floating next to him.
The aggressive mug attacks the same vine and pushes it back more, causing some damage, but not
enough to get rid of it.

The hostile plants continue to attack the group, this time with their psychic abilities.
Gven and Bilwin appear to be the most impacted, each of them momentarily holding their
heads and closing their eyes in agony. Emitting an odor, one of the vines is able to
enchant Gven again, who suddenly wants nothing more than to cradle the pretty flowers in
her hands.

<!-- Round 2 -->

<!-- Step-by-step
* Dolor - Attacks the vine in front of him with Gleaming Blade for 25 damage.
  * Off-hand attack with his shortsword connects for 6 damage.
* Mond - Casts [Fire Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2103-fire-bolt)
  at a vine close to him, causing 18 damage.
* Gven - Approaches the vine closest to her, about to touch it, but is able to
  shake off the enchantment.
* Grindlefoot - Attacks with his [Flame Blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2106-flame-blade),
  causing 10 damage and also punches the vine with his other hand, for 3 damage.
* Nyx Whisperfang (Chris Sells) - Bursts out of the jungle into their midst, his
  scimitar bursts into flame, and he screams "Kazah!" as he slashes at the vine 5
  twice, causing it 19 and 20 damage.
  * A male [tabaxi](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Tabaxi_(5e_Race_Variant)) who is
    large and muscular, covered in scars that interrupt his fur line, wearing scale
    mail, and carrying a scimitar. 
* Bilwin - Casts [Guiding Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2133-guiding-bolt)
  at vine 3 for 21 damage and the spiritual weapon attacks vine 3, causing 18 damage.
  * Vine 3 is killed.
* Vine 6 - Attacks Gven and misses.
* Vine 2 - Attacks Bilwin for 17 psychic damage.
  * Nyx reacts and casts a blood curse at the vine, that subtracts 4 1d6 from damage to Bilwin.
* Vine 4 - Attacks Dolor for 6 psychic damage.
* Vine 1 - Attacks Dolor and misses.
  * Dolor reacts with [Hellish Rebuke](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hellish-rebuke) for 7 fire damage.
* Vine 5 - Attacks Grindlefoot and misses.
 -->

Again, Dolor swings Gleaming Blade at the vine in front of him, following it with
his off-hand sword, both causing a significant amount of damage. Standing in the middle of
the group, Mond directs [Fire Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2103-fire-bolt) at a vine
close to him, the mote of fire incinerating large parts of it.

Enchanted, Gven approaches the vine closest to her but is able to shake off the unwanted
desire to touch it. Standing next to Gven, Grindlefoot attacks with his
[Flame Blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2106-flame-blade), slicing through a
piece of the vine and setting fire to a few flowers. He follows up with a frustrated
punch, "stop enchanting my friend, you slithering ninny!"

Suddenly, a large ball of fur carrying a flaming scimitar explodes from the jungle into
their midst. Screaming "Kazah!", their new ally attacks one of the vines with a vengeance
and fury, tearing it into pieces, although it's still alive and thrusting about.

Bilwin is momentarily transfixed by this tall, muscular
[tabaxi](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Tabaxi_(5e_Race_Variant)) who has unexpectedly
come to their aid. It's covered in scars that interrupt its fur lines, wearing
scale mail, and carring a lengthy scmitar that is covered in magical flames.
Blinking his eyes a few times to make sure it's real, Bilwin realizes that they're still
in the midst of battle. He casts [Guiding Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2133-guiding-bolt)
at a vine and his spiritual weapon attacks the same one with its force spell. He can
see the vine and its flowers shrivel up into death.

Two of the vines attempt to charm Gven and Dolor, but the half-orc and tiefling are able
to resist the magical compulsion. Dolor reacts with
[Hellish Rebuke](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hellish-rebuke), inflicting a fiery
consequence on the plant. Two other vines attack Bilwin and Dolor with their psychic
assaults, forcing them to stop fighting momentarily and deal with the pain. 
Nyx reacts and casts a [blood curse](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/blood-hunter:blood-curse) at
one of the vines, reducing the damage to Bilwin. The fifth vine attempts to enchant Grindlefoot
and fails.

<!-- Round 3 -->

<!-- Step-by-step
* Dolor - Attacks the vine in front of him with Gleaming Blade for 23 damage.
  * Off-hand attack with his shortsword connects for 6 damage.
  * Vine 1 is killed.
* Mond - Casts [Lightning Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2167-lightning-bolt)
  at vine 2, causing 28 damage.
* Gven - Attacks vine 6 with Tempest Edge twice, for 11 and 15 slashing damage.
* Grindlefoot - Attacks with his [Flame Blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2106-flame-blade),
  causing 13 damage and also punches the vine with his other hand, for 3 damage.
* Nyx Whisperfang (Chris Sells) - Attacks vine 4 with his flaming scimitar twice, for 18 and 15 damage.
  * Vine 4 is killed.
* Bilwin - Attacks vine 2 with his hurdy-gurdy case and connects for 7 damage, even though he
  slipped and fell as he swung the instrument. 
  * Spiritual weapon imitates Bilwin's slip, but with more grace, and attacks vine 2 for 9 damage.
* Vine 6 - Spews the granular substance from its flowers at the group, enchanting Dolor and Gven.
* Vine 2 - Attacks Dolor and misses.
* Vine 5 - Attacks Grindlefoot for 8 psychic damage.
* Vines 1, 3, and 4 are dead
-->

Swinging Gleaming Blade in one hand and his shortsword in the other, Dolor slices
the vine attacking him into pieces, finally killing it. He only has a moment of rest
before another vine puffs its purple powder in the air and the tiefling finds himself
inexplicably drawn to it. He must get a closer look to really appreciate its beauty.

Mond casts his signature pink [Lightning Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2167-lightning-bolt)
at one of the yellow creepers, hurting it enough that it flinches slightly in retreat. 

Gven and Grindlefoot continue to assault the vine closest to them. With Tempest Edge
and the halfling wielding his [Flame Blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2106-flame-blade),
they're obviously hurting the flower more than it likes. Grindlefoot gives it another
punch with his off-hand, "Don't like that, do ya now!"

The muscle-bound tabaxi swings his scimitar at a vine twice, killing it with the second
blow.

Inspired by the feline warrior next to him, Bilwin takes an extra-long backswing with
his hurdy-gurdy's case, walloping the yellow creeper in front of him and removing several of
its flowers. Unluckily, he overswings and ends up comically falling to his butt on the
ground. The spiritual weapon vibrates slightly, as though it's laughing at its creator,
then attacks the vine in the same manner, albeit much more gracefully.

Gven accidentally inhales some of the spewed purple granules that charmed Dolor and she,
once again, decides to give the pretty flowers a big hug. The two other remaining vines
attack Dolor and Grindlefoot with their psychic powers, but only the halfling appears
affected, briefly revealing the pain in his expression.

<!-- Round 4 -->

<!-- Step-by-step
* Dolor - Shakes off the enchantment.
* Mond - Casts [Lightning Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2167-lightning-bolt)
  at vines 5 and 6, causing 32 damage each.
  * Vine 5 is killed.
* Gven - Shakes off the enchantment.
* Grindlefoot - Attacks vine 6 with his [Flame Blade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2106-flame-blade),
  causing 16 damage and killing it.
  * Vine 6 is killed.
* Nyx Whisperfang (Chris Sells) - Pushes past Dolor, who is eagerly approaching the last
  living vine, steps over Bilwin, who is enthralled by this heroic tabaxi in their midst,
  and attacks the last vine with his scimitar, for 22 and 23 damage.
  * Vine 2 is killed.
-->

Dolor and Gven are able to shake off their enchantment, but don't have enough mental
capacity to respond with any attacks. Once more, Mond casts his trusty pink
[Lightning Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2167-lightning-bolt
at two of the vines, killing one and significantly hurting the other.

With unusual gumption and flourish, Grindlefoot blitzes towards a flowering vine with
his flaming sword. A single swipe of the blade cuts the creeper cleanly in half at
the thickest part of its vine, and it shrivels up, embracing the decay of death.
"Plants are supposed to be friends, not foes!"

The strange tabaxi pushes past Dolor, still recovering from the stupor of enchantment,
and steps over Bilwin, who is lying on the ground after slipping, and attacks the last
yellow creeper vine. It swings the fiery scimitar with fury, the muscles in its arms
rippling with energy and strength, cutting the plant into an uncountable number of pieces.

---

After killing the last vine, the large tabaxi turns to the group and says, "I suppose
introductions are in order. I'm Nyx Whisperfang and, well, this is what I do. These damned
[musk creepers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Yellow_musk_creeper) turn their
victims into zombies that serve them. They're all over this island and nearly impossible
to spot before you're in range of their psychic attacks or being charmed by the puffs of
purple pollin. I've been tracking a particularly large lizard zombie. Have y'all seen it?"

Just then, before anyone can respond to Nyx, they hear a thunderous roar and the ground
beneath their feet begins to shake. Bilwin turns to Grindlefoot, "Please tell me that you
decided to summon that helpful pink rhinocerous again."
Grindlefoot looks up into the air thoughtfully.

Watching in the direction where the roar came from, the group can see the tops of the trees
moving and shaking, as though something very large is pushing them aside. In a matter of
moments, the creature comes into view and they can see it's a much larger version of the
reptile they encountered a few days ago, except that it's undead.

Stopping twenty feet from them, they can see that the [tyrannosaurus rex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17041-tyrannosaurus-rex)
has rotting skin that only covers some of its bones and body, the eyes are sunken, with one eyeball
hanging slightly out of its socket, and yet the claws seem as sharp as any well-honed blade.
Standing still, it begins to kvetch and make a retching sound while extending its snout,
three humanoid zombies tumble out of its mouth.

<!-- Initiative rolls:

  Dolor - 22

-->

<!-- Round 1 -->

<!-- Step-by-step
* Gven - Enables her [Barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/)
  and attacks with Tempest Edge, missing on her first swing then connecting on her second, for 16 damage.
* Dolor - Rushes in next to Gven with Gleaming Blade, slashing at the T-Rex for 21 damage. He also strikes
  with his shortsword in his off-hand for 12 damage.
* T-Rex - Spits out 1 more zombie (as a [legendary action](https://beforeyouroll.com/legendary-actions-5e/))
  and then bites Dolor, causing 34 damage, and lifting him up into the air.
  * Dolor uses [uncanny dodge](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rogue#toc_10) and halves the damage to 17.
  * The creature swings its tail at Gven and misses.
* Grindlefoot - Casts [Haste](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2138-haste) on Nyx, doubling his speed and gaining
  an additional action during each turn.
* Mond - Casts [Burning Hands](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2021-burning-hands) at 2 of the zombies,
  for 23 damage each and killing them both
* T-Rex - Takes another legendary action to throw Dolor up into the air, but Bilwin is ready and casts
  [Feather Fall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2095-feather-fall) on the tiefling—he floats to the ground
  like Mary Poppins.
* Bilwin - Casts [Turn Undead](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Turn_undead) at
  the rotting dinosaur and it's vomited humanoids, but only the humanoids flee.
  * His [Spiritual Weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon) appears and attacks the
    T-Rex, causing 7 damage.
* Nyx - Attacks twice with his flaming scimitar, thanks to Grindlefoot's [Haste](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2138-haste)
  spell, for 69 damage to the T-Rex.
  * Another zombie falls out of the reptile's mouth and attacks Nyx, for 4 damage.
  * Nyx casts a curse at the T-Rex that marks it with the [Jolly Roger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolly_Roger)
    and allows Nyx to track it, and causes 1 psychic damage.
-->

Not wasting any time, Gven enables her [barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/)
and attacks with Tempest Edge. She misses with her first swing then takes a chunk out of its leg with her second.

Dolor rushes in next to Gven, wielding Gleaming Blade in one hand and his shortsword in the other. Slashing both blades
at the T-Rex, he causes enough damage to make it roar in agony—or defiance—and it regurgitates one more
zombie. Before the zombie is even on the ground, the dinosaur scoops up Dolor in its mouth, bites him and
begins to aggressively swing him around. Keeping his wits about him despite his dire circumstances, Dolor uses
[uncanny dodge](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rogue#toc_10) to reduce the significant damage from the bite.
The 30-foot tall creature swings its tail at Gven and she's able to dodge it.

Seeing that Nyx is quite the warrior, Grindlefoot casts [Haste](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2138-haste),
doubling the tabaxi's speed and allowing him to make additional attacks.

Without hesitating, Mond casts [Burning Hands](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2021-burning-hands) at two of
the zombies, killing them both instantly. 

The T-Rex ferociously throws Dolor up into the air, but Bilwin is ready and casts
[Feather Fall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2095-feather-fall) on the tiefling. He floats to the ground
like a soft, spherical bundle of dandelion seeds.

Bilwin suddenly realizes that he can channel a divine energy he's never actually used before.
Looking intently at the small horde of zombies, both humanoid and dinosaur, he calls on
[Hanseath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hanseath) to help him cast
[Turn Undead](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Turn_undead). Almost immediately, the
humanoid zombies flee in seeming terror, but the tyrannosaurus rex shakes its head in anger
and remains. Bilwin's hurdy-gurdy-shaped [Spiritual Weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon)
appears next to him and attacks the rotting T-Rex, only causing enough damage to barely register
with the beast.

Thanks to Grindlefoot's Haste spell, the muscular tabaxi, Nyx, attacks the dinosaur twice with his flaming scimitar.
The beast is looking much worse than when they first saw it, but still standing and ready
to attack the group. It retches again, spitting up one more zombie that immediately attacks Nyx, cutting him
across the shin. Not wanting the T-Rex to get away this time, Nyx casts a curse that marks it with the
[Jolly Roger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolly_Roger) and allows the tabaxi to track it.

<!-- Round 2 -->

<!-- Step-by-step
* Gven - Skimmies up the T-Rex's tail and back, lifts Tempest Edge as high as she can, and then plunges
  it into the dinosaurs skull, killing it.
* From the undead T-Rex's remains, 4 more zombies emerge.
* Dolor - Attacks the closest zombie with Gleaming Blade, for 12 damage, and his off-hand shortsword, for another 7 damage.
* Grindlefoot - Swipes his staff at the zombie that Dolor attacked, for 9 damage.
* Mond - Casts [Tasha's Mind Whip](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:tashas-mind-whip) at the 3 remaining zombies,
  for 13 damage each.
* Bilwin - Attacks a zombie with his trusty hurdy-gurdy case, but misses.
  * The spiritual weapon attacks the same zombie, connecting for 9 damage.
* Nyx - Launches at the 2 remaining zombies with his scimitar, for 15 and 9 damage, respectively.
* Zombie 1 - Attacks Nyx with its hands, trying to bite him, but misses.
* Zombie 2 - Also attacks Nyx with its clawing hands and causes 5 damage.
* Zombies 3 & 4 - Attack Gven, but miss.
-->

With a battle roar, Gven skimmies up the T-Rex's tail and back, lifts Tempest Edge as high as she
can, and plunges it into the dinosaur's skull. Its body convulses and slowly topples over, with
Gven riding it to the ground and calmly stepping off into the dirt.

Four more zombies violently erupt from the undead tyrannosaurus rex's remains, clawing at the air
and heading towards the adventurers. Two of the zombies immediately attack Gven, but she's able to
evade them with ease. Dolor isn't fazed and immediately attacks one, cutting off
a few of its limbs. Grindlefoot follows up, twirling his sturdy wooden staff with finesse, to remove
yet another grotesque piece of the zombie's anatomy. 

Mond lashes out at the three other zombies with [Tasha's Mind Whip](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:tashas-mind-whip),
visibly tearing into their undead flesh. Bilwin swings his hurdy-gurdy case at one, but narrowly misses.
His spirtual hurdy-gurdy goes after the same zombie, connecting with its force melee attack.

Nyx launches himself at two of the undead humanoids, slashing and slicing into them, cutting off
several pieces of undead flesh. Instead of defending themselves, they attack Nyx, trying to bite and claw
him anywhere they're able to. The tabaxi receives a small cut on his forearm from one of the claws,
which only makes him angrier.

<!-- Round 3 -->

<!-- Step-by-step
* Gven - With two swipes of Tempest Edge, she finishes 2 of the undead opponents.
* Dolor - Attacks one with Gleaming Blade for 16 damage, then his off-hand shortsword for another 5 damage.
* Grindlefoot - With flourishing pokes and twirls of his staff, he takes out the two remaining zombies.
  He's as surprised as the rest.
 -->

With muscles rippling beneath her leather armor, Gven's first swing is a blur that cleaves through
a zombie's skull, leaving its body standing headless for a few seconds. With a powerful second strike
of Tempest Edge, her blade finds its mark in the chest of the other undead creature. It collapses,
lifeless eyes staring blankly into the blue sky.

Dolor moves with a grace the group has come to expect from the tiefling rogue as he parries a clumsy
attack with swift counterstrikes, Gleaming Blade and then the shortsword in his off-hand.

The undead creature is in dire shape, scraggly limbs barely hanging from its torso. Grindlefoot
flourishes his wooden staff with an unusual flair, twirling it around his body a few times before
finally connecting with the zombie's skull. It audibly snaps backward into an awkward position and
listlessly falls to the ground, lifeless.

With a look of disdain, the halfling quietly says "that'll teach ya to mess with a farmer."
