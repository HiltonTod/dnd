The morning arrives to find the adventurers well rested and gathered in the sitting area down the hall from their
rooms. Conversation is minimal, each pondering their dreams from the night—surprisingly realistic and immsersive.

Grindlefoot dreamt of a spider weaving an intricate web that spans worlds. The spider's filaments shoot off in
every direction, seemingly without purpose. Yet, each gossamer strand represents a place the spider has been or
will be. There is purpose in the network of gossamer silk. Just as the halfling's journey has taken him across
a continent and planes of existence, the spider's web represents its complex journey. Unlike the halfling, a
spider doesn't worry about navigating its web, it trusts in its instincts. The druid takes comfort from his dream
and embraces his journey, no longer worrying quite as much about what the future holds.

The barbarian's dreams were dominated by her brother's presence, or lack thereof. Gven works best with straight
lines, direct correlations between events and results, actions and consequences. Torp's actions make no sense
to the half-orc. They had the same experiences as children, lived in the same area during their formative years,
received the love and support of their parents, but his choices are the antithesis of hers. In her dreams, she
found herself navigating the rain-soaked back alleys of a noisy and chaotic town. Wet, cold, and hungry, she
comes across a public house where she can see the warm hearth fires burning and hear the jovial voices coming
from inside. Then it becomes hazy and the half-orc is pushed back violently, "Your kind isn't welcome here!"
Upon reflection in the morning, Gven understands that those weren't her memories or even her subconscious fears.
She wonders, whose were they?

Dolor rests quietly on a cushioned chair with gilded edging along its corners, replaying his own vision. 
He received an unexpected visitor, Fenseck, the [Efreeti](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16854-efreeti)
[djinni](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16842-djinni) who granted the tiefling his
[warlock](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/7-warlock) powers in Aish's temple on Amonah.

"How are things?"

"Nobody's died yet."

The elemental chuckles as they respond, "That's a lie. You nor your friends have perished, but many around you
have gone to meet their maker. Often at your own hands, be it by sword or spell."

Dolor lowers his head in acquiesence to the statement. "That's fair, but never at our initiation." Returning his
gaze to Fenseck, "What can you tell me about Vecna?"

For a brief moment, Fenseck visibly shutters, "I don't subscribe to the notions of good and evil. Their meanings
shift too quickly and too easily, depending on the judge's perspective." The djinni pauses and becomes still then
looks into Dolor's eyes with a seriousness unlike their other interactions. "Vecna is one of the most dangerous
creatures in any plane of existence and he's dedicated to following a path of destruction. Not just a single continent,
planet, or even plane. He means to destroy everything and remake it in a way only he sees. I would not dream of
standing against Vecna." Their face returns to its normal mysterious grin, "But I wish you well on this path you've
chosen. It shall be interesting to watch."

Returning to the present and looking around at his companions, Dolor thought to himself, "Interesting isn't the
word I would have chosen."

Bilwin rests on a chaise lounge that's slightly too tall for the dwarf, causing his booted feet to dangle above
the floor. But that doesn't seem to matter to the cleric, staring at the wall opposite his seat as though it's
a landscape miles away. Seeing his companions from years ago, fallen along the way as they pursued a piece of the
[Rod of Law](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Rod_of_Seven_Parts), has stirred up more than just fragmented
memories. Finally, he can remember each of his old companions clearly in his mind, yet not the reason for their
quest. Nor can he remember why he abandoned it. More memories yield more questions than answers. Not the least of,
why did he end up with this lot? In his dreams, one of his old friends, Brevin, a white-haired dwarf with a
waist-length beard posed the same question. "So, why did ya?" Recovering from his trance-like state, Bilwin looks
at the others and ponders the question.

A bedroom door opens and Mond enters the hallway, dressed in his travel clothes and looking refreshed. The last of
the companions to wake, the half-elf approaches the others and nods good morning. "A night without restless dreams
is a gift to be appreciated." The others look at him and then each other, wondering why the half-elf was spared.

The smell of bacon permeates the sitting area, followed shortly by Malaina's silent entrance. "Are you ready to
break your fast with us? There is coffee, freshly squeezed juice—natural, not magical—and plenty of scintillating
choices for you to consider." With the last statement, she winks at Gven.
