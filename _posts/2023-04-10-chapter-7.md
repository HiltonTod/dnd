After the group's short rest, it's early midday and the sun is shining, creating a natural
warmth found in the late spring season. The adventurer's follow Grindlefoot, in wolf form,
away from the Ha-derech towards the narrow trail that leads off into the forest and up towards
the Mountains of the Lower Jaw. His wolf's snout sniffs the trail, head moving side to side
and lifting up every once in a while to catch any air scents. 

It doesn't take long for the mood to alter, as the trees become denser, pushing closer to
each other, and creating a stillness in the air. The temperature drops significantly, even
though they know that the sun is shining and warming those who can feel its rays. The path
grows increasingly difficult to traverse, more like a game trail than one frequented by people.

After about an hour of walking, they discover that they're crossing the same stream
they did a short while ago. The creek's water disrupted the scent that Grindlefoot was
following and they inadvertently circled back. He's able to find goblin foot prints that
coincide with the doll's scent and they move forward. Soon enough, they discover additional
paw prints on the trail and Gven notices some scat, both of which belong to wolves. It
appears as though the trail is frequented by a local wolf pack.

They continue walking forward in a diamond shape, with Grindlefoot leading, Gven and Xantic
side-by-side, and Dolor bringing up the rear. Within minutes, Dolor hears significant
movement in the forest and brush around them as they come upon a large boulder, taller and
wider than Gven, that is blocking the trail. A large wolf jumps to the top of the boulder
and five more spread around its base, all of them growling an audible warning, also
apparent from their bared teeth.
