Midnight has come and gone while the adventurers and Low Elves have defended the
village of Wayside from the first wave of the goblin horde. The Low Elves have been
protecting Scribbles & Nibs and Preva's Flowers, but the adventurers have been
focused on their own battles to save the Buzzin Bee...and the town and townsfolk.

They have little time to catch their breath before Dolor notices that a
[giant spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16895-giant-spider) is frantically
waving several of its legs from the top of a tree. "Ready yourselves, here we
go again!"

Fight choreography:

**Round 7**
*   15 goblins come out from the treeline and reveal themselves, 250 feet from the Buzzin Bee.
    *   5 of the goblins stop to fire their short bows at the heroes, all arrows missing their marks.
    *   10 of the goblins pass through the treeline and dash ahead 60 feet.
*   Dolor takes a long shot with his shortbow at one of the stationary goblins at the treeline,
    hitting his mark and killing it. "Huzzah!" he exclaims up to Cindel in the second story window.
*   Grindlefoot, as a giant spider, deftly climbs down his tree and bites one of the 4
    remaining goblins, killing it. Fortunately, he remembers to not drain the creature's blood
    before his spidery instincts take over.
*   Cindel fires her longbow at the closest goblins and misses.
*   Gven readies her two hand axes for short range throws, having thrown all 4 of her javelins.

**Round 8**
