Bilwin and Dolor continue into the storage room, stepping over and around the unkempt and pungent-smelling
dwarf sprawled on the floor. Wearing leather armor, the dwarf's lengthy red beard, pulled together in a single
plait braid, moves up and down with the cadence of his loud snoring. Based on the empty bottles surrounding
him, the dwarf drank himself into a an inebriated slumber.

Peering around the room at the stores, the two companions decide to leave them where they rest on the rickety
shelves. The group has enough rations and it's not worth getting sick, or poisoned for that matter.

Bilwin kneels next to the red-bearded dwarf and shakes him gently in an attempt to rouse him. "Hey, friend!
Heeelllllooooo and good morning. At least, I think it's still morning outside. My internal clock is a bit off
lately for some reason. Wakey, wakey, hands off...oh, there you are."

The drunken dwarf's eyes slowly begin to open, creased as though peering into bright lights—or battling a major
hangover. All of a sudden, surprise grabs hold of him and he tries to jump to his feet, ready to defend himself
and his lair. Instead, he remains prone on the floor while lifting his head and rolling over to his side. His
eyes open wider and finally focus on Bilwin and Dolor. Seeing them for the first time and realizing they're not
holding their weapons, he slowly rises to a seated position.

"Let's get you out of this tiny room and back to the others. We can talk there."

The dwarf grunts a response and then unhurriedly moves to stand up, stumbling to each side several times on his
journey to being vertical. He shoves off Bilwin's offers of assistance. Finally standing, he puts both hands
on his hips in a posture of confidence, but his right hand misses and slides off across his buttocks throwing
him off balance. He loses his balance and falters to the side, catching himself with a hand on one of the shelves.

"Ach, aye. This is whit I wis lookin' for! Cannae leave wi'oot some scran, noo can I." He grabs three wine
bottles from the shelf—probably the only unopened bottles that remain.

The three successfully navigate the spinning cylinder to rejoin Gven, Mond, Grindlefoot, and Gustaf. Although,
the dwarf appears to use an intoxicated form of tumbling to do so.

Grindlefoot hands the dwarf a flask of water, while silently casting
[Lesser Restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2164-lesser-restoration) that immediately makes him sober.

He notices the change, "Och, nay, we cannae hae that, noo can we!" He grabs one of the wine bottles from his pack
and guzzles the contents. Dropping the empty bottle to the floor, he sways a tiny bit. "Aye, loads better."

Bilwin asks, "What brought you here? And why did you lock yourself in that storeroom?"

"Name's Thamnoki Grumblebuster, but folks call me Tham. I thocht me group wis lookin' fur treasure, but the
arseholes lied tae me. They were a bunch o' zealots come tae tak' the stupid tests. Somethin' aboot trials
tae prove their worth tae The One, whoever the hell that micht be. I thocht tae hing aboot and see if they
found anythin' o' value, but they went an' got killed by some huge, armoured beastie. I didnae want any part
o' that shite, so I ran aff and locked masel' in the first room I could find. Lucky fur me, it hid food an'
drink...plenty o' drink. That's ma story. Whaur are you lot aff tae?"

"We're headed back this way," Bilwin points to the closed metal door in the hallway headed to the north.
"Searching for clues about The One and the war it's trying to start in Eritz. Join us?"

"Aye, let's go."

Making his way to the door, the red-bearded dwarf pushes it open with little effort. Ten feet down the hall,
another metal door blocks their way. Without waiting for anyone's suggestion or approval, Tham moves forward
and opens the second door, only to reveal yet another metal door ten feet down the hall. Again, he continues
forward and opens the door without hesitation, moving a few steps into a gigantic cavern, larger than any of
the previous ones in the temple. They can't see further than sixty feet in any direction with their darkvision.
Based on the curvature of the walls by the entrance, the cavern is round and at least a few hundred feet in diameter.

"Something's not quite right," Dolor whispers to the group. "I sense a great body of water, but don't see any
around here." Looking ahead, the tiefling and group sees a shimmering reflection around the room.

Grindlefoot yells, "HELLO!" Waiting a few seconds, they don't hear a response, or an echo.

Bilwin makes the decision for the group and follows the pathway forward, straight ahead from the entrance into
what they think is the center of the giant cave. The group walks slowly with Bilwin and Tham leading, Mond, Dolor,
Grindlefoot, and Gustaf in line behind them, and Gven bringing up the rear. After thirty feet, they feel the
temperature rising quickly and sweat begins to appear on their foreheads.

Looking around, Dolor discovers the cause of the shimmering. "We're inside a huge bubble! Look at the other
side, that's boiling water, which explains the heat. What sort of magic is keeping all that water boiling,
not to mention this translucent bubble that's protecting us from being boiled alive? And why? What sort of
elaborate, deadly puzzle is this room?"

They continue walking for another thirty to forty feet and Mond notices the terrain shifting from hardened
stone to sand and gravel. The half-elf can barely make out something sticking out of the sand ahead of them,
at the edge of his darkvision. Moving closer, the blurred edges come into focus. It's the pommel of a long
greatsword, jutting out of the sand. As they cautiously move closer, they hear a low rumbling and the sand
beneath their feet and around the staked sword begins to shake.

A [giant crab](https://www.worldanvil.com/block/1121963) erupts from the shifting sand and scitters sideways,
blocking their path to the sword. It wears a shiny, rune-covered copper band around one of its claws, which,
notably, does not prevent it from being used.

<!-- Round 1 -->

Seeing the fifteen foot tall crab move between them and the sword, Gven invokes her
[rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/), draws Tempest
Edge from its scabbard across her back, and rushes in to attack. She swings at one of the claws twice,
both slicing through the crab's thick carapace, letting its blood streak out.

Having attuned himself to Whelm before entering the cavern, Bilwin hears the warhammer's encouragement
in his mind. "Aye, lad, let's pound this damnable beast!" The dwarf turns the hammer upright and slams
the handle on the ground, releasing a [shockwave](https://www.5esrd.com/database/spell/shockwave/) that
undulates through the gigantic crab and, yet, it seems unaffected.

With Gven's attack, she's within easy reach of the crab, who reaches out with a claw and grabs hold
of the barbarian. The creature squeezes with such strength that she's momentarily stunned and unable
to respond.

Mond raises both of his hands and concentrates, releasing a [bolt of lightning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618999-lightning-bolt)
that that crashes into the crab with an ear-splitting crack. It squeals in pain, but continues to hold
Gven in its grasp.

Taking advantage of the battle's distraction, Grindlefoot attempts to sneak around the group to investigate
the sword in the sand. The crab notices the halfling's movements and scuttles to the side, blocking his path.

Tham moves forward forcefully—and seeming sudden sobriety—to punch the crab's lower shell with a fury of
blows that appear to cause some damage.

With Gleaming Blade in his hand, Dolor attacks the cheliped holding Gven. The magical blade cuts through
the thick hide, letting more blood flow and obviously hurting the crab. It responds in anger, lifting Gven
higher and then forcefully smashing her into the sandy ground. She groans in agony at the mistreatment.
