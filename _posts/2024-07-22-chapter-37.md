As the afternoon wears on and the sun begins to set, Dolor continues to follow the ancient
road way, although plant growth and time has obscured most of it from view. Realizing that
they'll need to set up camp soon, he notices a large tree that has fallen over and might
provide some shelter, or at least a semblance of cover. Upon investigating the decaying
tree, they discover that it's hollowed out and has barely enough room for them to gather
and rest while concealed. 

Scouting around their tree, Grindlefoot discovers a small tiered waterfall that comes
from a spring close by. To the halflings surprise and delight, there are sweet potatoes
and bananas growing near the waterfall. "Ah-ha, we have dinner!"

The night proceeds without any interruptions, allowing the adventurers to rest well
for the next day.

Long rest....

Having the last watch of the night, Grindlefoot decides to make banana and sweet potato
pancakes for the breakfast. The others wake to the aromatic smells of hot pancakes over
a small fire.

After breakfast, the group realizes that by following the old road they wandered slightly
West from their intended path to the mountain temple.

Mond says, "Since we accidentally moved closer to the
[earthmote](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Earthmote),
is anyone else interested in seeing it close up? This seems like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
I've read about them, but they're exceptionally rare and I never expected to encounter one."

"That will likely take us most of the day," Dolor responds. "We've come farther West than
I thought, but that hanging rock is still probably another 2-3 hours walk through this
jungle—away from the temple. If we fix our direction and start towards the temple now, we'll
have only lost a few hours."

They agree that a floating boulder is worth looking at closer and head off towards the
oddity.
