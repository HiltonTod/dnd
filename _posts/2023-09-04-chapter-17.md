_For brevity's sake, the narrator has left out much of the dialog and banter, although it was
quite entertaining in the moments._

The adventurers return to the Broken Spy Glass and are soon joined by Rightside,
who has discovered that Davanor is an interesting character. He's referred to as
a damian, someone who can get you whatever you want...using whatever means are
necessary. They're usually creative and innovative in their methods, as well
as unsavory and amoral. From his time in the city, Dolor knows that damians are
people to stay away from, which both Rightside and Tella confirm.

Mond reveals the etymology of _damian_, that it means _blood_ in the Old Language.
They surmise that's why the woman asked for a sample of their blood, their soul
and personhood is the collateral for any failures.
