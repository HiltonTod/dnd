Grindlefoot looks around the room, at his companions, and then the silver-haired woman.  "Are we really here?
Is this parlor imaginary or a dream or yet another plane?"

The woman's face is mostly expressionless, with a subtle hint of surprise. Meanwhile, the man behind her is
obviously astonished at their appearance.

"You were summoned accidentally. Come to the parlor. I need a drink." She turns around and leaves the room through
the same doorway she was standing in, neither beckoning nor waiting for them to follow.

"I thought this was the parlor? Isn't this a parlor? It looks fancy enough to be a parlor. Do aristocrats, or
rather wizards, have more than one parlor in their castles? Is it a size thing? Do they drink beer in a parlor?"
Bilwin's questions continue as he follows Grindlefoot and the others into the adjoining room.

This parlor is twice the size of the room they appeared in, but furnished similarly. The statuesque woman
reaches one of the two large settees, sits down gracefully, and then motions her hand towards a cocktail cart
in the corner. A karafe of red wine floats to her, accompanied by a large bowl-shaped glass. Reaching her,
the karafe tilts slightly, pouring a sizable amount into the glass, which then floats into her hand. The karafe
lowers itself to rest on a small table to the side of the couch.

The companions make their way to the sitting area, Bilwin and Grindlefoot take seats on the second settee, Mond
and Dolor remain standing, and Gven sits awkwardly on a divan, holding her greatsword, Tempest Edge, in front of
her with the tip of its scabbard resting on an ornamental rug.

Laying comfortably in a chaise lounge off to the side, another woman appears ambivalous to their presence or the
situation or, perhaps, everything. Her raven hair cascades past her starkly white shoulders, the sleeveless
dress she's wearing barely goes past her knees, and her legs are crossed in a relaxing pose. Behind her is a
raised dais filled with lush plants and greenery, a small congregation of greenery. She tips her glass towards
the newcomers in acknowledgement.

The man remains standing behind the settee, looking over the companions. With a bald head, closely-trimmed beard,
and penetrating eyes, he looks like a hawk searching for prey. He wears grey, high-collared robes with red velvet
trim, and medium-sized gold hoops hang from each ear. 

In a deep, melodic voice, "Let's not be rude, Alustriel. I'm sure our guests would enjoy some refreshments." With
a wave of his hand, the karafe levetates and begins to pour wine into glasses for the companions.

"I am [Mordenkainen](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Mordenkainen), on the chaise is
[Tasha](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Iggwilv), and this," motioning to the silver-haired wizard,
"is [Alustriel](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Alustriel_Silverhand)."

Lost in thought, Alustriel finishes her wine and then watches the karafe refill her glass. "I don't understand
why it didn't work." She swirls the red wine in the bowl-shaped glass, releasing the aromas and watching the
legs slowly glide down the inside of the glass.

"My apologies. This must be quite shocking for you all. Indeed, more so for you than us. As Mordenkainen said,
I am Alustriel and this is my home, The Sanctum. I am a high mage of Silverymoon. Tasha is," she pauses momentarily,
"also a skilled practicioner." Tasha emits a low snicker, although the depths of her eyes show a more volatile
reaction. "And, of course, Mordenkainen."

He turns his head sligthly to the side, showing them his favorite profile, and flutters his eyes. When they don't
respond, he turns back to them with a glare that silently screams, "You should know who I am or it is to your
own peril."

During their downtime, Mond has taken to Gustaf's habit of drawing maps of their travels and adventures,
including the most recent, City of Neverwinter.
