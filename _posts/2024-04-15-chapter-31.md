"You're an interesting sight. Curious what brought you here. Won't you come closer
so we can converse without yelling." It was more of a command than a request
from the female who must stand 25 feet tall. She had a pale blue complexion
and long dark hair that seemed to shimmer between brown, black, and even
the deep blue of a storm cloud. Dressed in leather armor that had obviously seen its
fair share of use in battle and casually holding a massive greatsword, with the point
resting on the ground, she was one to be careful around.

Cap'n Don pulls the Iron Vulture as close as he can to the giant rock she sits
atop of, although still a fair distance because of the shallow water surrounding
the two hundred foot tall outcrop. A small island sits close to the rock, where they
can see some trees and vegetation off a distance beyond the sandy beach.

"Welcome, travelers." She looks off into the distance for a moment and then back
to them. "This is a place I come to think...and listen to the stars speak. That is,
if they choose to. Their nature can be...fickle, to say the least. As I said,
you surprise me with your presence. Do tell." Again, it was more of a command than
a request.

Intrigued by the events, Grindlefoot returns to his halfling form, shifting back from
the [giant spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16895-giant-spider). Unfortunately,
he's still up on the bow mast amidst all of the webbing and immediately becomes
entangled in his own butt-yarn. Struggling valiantly to free himself, the movement
only seals the door on his prison. He becomes so intertwined with the knotted up
webbing, that his voice is muffled beyond recognition. "Mmmmfpppfh, bwwweeelllfff
ddeeee! Ooohhfff mmuuhh bwooootttthh issshh ffrriiied uppfh!"

Dolor asks, "who are you and can we trust you with our safety?"

"I am Veylara and you'll be safe...from the storm...while you're here. To be clear,
you **will** remain here until I decide you may continue your journey. That is, **if**
I allow you to continue."

Seeing no other options, Dolor, Bilwin, Mond, and Gven take the small dinghy from
the Iron Vulture to the beach. It's a short trip, but Veylara motions her hand and
a small wave kicks up, pushing them towards the beach even faster. She soon follows,
jumping down from her perch atop the rock to land smoothly in the waist-deep water
and easily strides towards the shore.

"And now, help me understand why you're here. Very few travelers, if any really,
discover this...." She looks around at the beach, up at the clear sky above them, and
then at the storm clouds surrounding them from a distance before continuing, "sanctuary
of mine."

Dolor speaks clearly and distinctly of doing what's right and how he's dedicated to
helping others whenever he can. Gven is less sure of herself, but saying that she needs
to stop her brother from committing genocide. Bilwin hesitantly describes his tenuous
connection with [Hanseath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hanseath) and how
he unexpectedly and suddenly rediscovered it; he's searching for his purpose. Mond,
in a surprisingly firm voice, tells Veylara that he's protecting his life and the
lives of others like him, those who practice magic.

Veylara remains quiet through their answers, allowing them the time and space and
opportunity to reflect before sharing. When they finish, she turns to Gven and says,
"walk with me." They stroll a little further down the beach, out of earshot from
the others. "You mention stopping your brother, but you're not his keeper nor are
you responsible for his actions. Why are you _really_ on this journey?"

Gven looks around uncomfortably, trying to reconcile the feelings within herself
and her often reckless behavior—that some might describe as courageous or brave.

"I come from a small tribe in the Badlands of Eritz. We depend on each other. Our
community relies on mutual respect and support; without those we won't make it through
the winter, let alone a lifetime. Most of them are human, but some of us are half-bloods:
half-orcs, half-elves, half-dwarves—yes, they really exist—and even an old half-goblin,
who happends to be crazier than a cleric arguing theology with a goat. But, for
the most part, we accept each other for who they...who we are."

Gven continues, "Our elders remember The Conflict and tell stories of those times
to remind us why we support each other this way. They also remind us of the misery
and death The Conflict visited upon so many, mostly innocents, people who were neither
religious nor magical. The hatred and greed, the wars and battles, the unnecessary
death of so many. I cannot abide that. It goes against everything I...we...were raised
to embrace and cherish. That's what troubles me so much, I can't believe my brother
believes this. Yet, here we are."

The large [storm giant](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17026-storm-giant) looks
down at Gven, "indeed, that is a fine reason for your journey."

The two meander back to the others and Veylara sits on a large rock, that's as
tall as Gven. "You want to go to Amonah, where the gods live in their physical form.
It's not a journey for the faint-hearted, for they are fickle and greedy and prone
to jealously betwixt each other. They can smite you with a thought, yet they also
enjoy being entertained...and worshipped."






Grindlefoot, still in the shape of a [giant spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16895-giant-spider)








They soon feel the rain becoming softer and the waves getting more gentle, when the
clouds part to reveal a calm sea surrounding a small island. Sitting on a very large
rock, two hundred feet high, is a large female figure, wearing polished scale mail
and holding a very large greatsword.

Nodding her head to the group, she says "you're a very bright thing in a very dark
place. That's unusual. I wasn't expecting that."

<!--
I THINK THIS GOES IN THE NEXT CHAPTER?

With an almost imperceptible wink
and smirk to Mond, the captain turns to the main mast and shouts up at Gven, currently on
watch in the crow's nest. "What do you see out off in the distance, barbarian?" 

With her gained experience and because she follows the
[Path of the Totem Warrior](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior), Gven has adopted
the Eagle's Aspect of the Beast that allows her to see 1 mile away as though it were only
100 feet. Not even having to squint, she sees heavy storm clouds blocking the light and pummeling
the sea with rains in the direction they're headed. It's unavoidable, unless they turn around
and head back to where they came from.
