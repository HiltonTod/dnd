Dolor steps into the dark, nondescript, underground passageway, discovering that it only goes for ten
feet before turning to the left, westward. Peeking around the corner, he sees that the passage
extends twenty feet and ends in a T, where they can go left or right, south or north. Reaching the
intersection, the tiefling looks both ways to discover a closed door on either end.

The group decides to move northward, to the right, and after twenty feet the hallway ends at the
closed door. Dolor and Grindlefoot have trouble pulling the door open, even with their combined strength
it doesn't budge. Gven eases her way past the others to face the door, gives it a quick lookover, and
gently pushes it into the unknown space. Throwing a grin at her two compatriots, "I'll go first,
there might be more puzzles ahead."

The room is fifty feet long and forty feet across to the side opposite the door they entered. A small
stream passes through it, flowing gently eastward from the west wall to the corner of the north and east
walls. The water is clear and they see several fish swimming with the current, mingling about and doing
fish-type things. Oddly though, the stream doesn't run through a channel in the room's stone floor, rather
it's suspended two feet in the air, not touching the ground.

Momentarily ignoring the supernatural stream, the adventurers note that there are no other doors
leading into or out of the room. On the eastern wall, six two-person kayaks hang on hooks, with
paddles next to them.

"Well, if that ain't sumthin! I wonder what's in the room at the other end of the hall?" Bilwin returns
to the hallway and hurriedly covers the distance to the other door, finding it unlocked.
