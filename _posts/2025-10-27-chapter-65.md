Behind the boar-like creature with tiny wings, there is an iron door made of thick bars that run vertically. Clearly
the creature is guarding a prison cell. They're holding a long trident, its butt resting on the stone floor and a ring
of keys hanging from the middle tine. The group stands silently, somewhat dumbfounded that their disguises are
working.

Grindlefoot looks around at the cavern and notices that the ceilings are quite high, probably twenty feet or more.
To their left as they entered, a passageway extends to the east into darkness. The creature, obviously a guard of
some sort, and the cell are on the west side of the cavern. The halfling can't see much past the large boar-headed
guard, but thinks that the cell is quite large.

While his eyes take in the room, the druid hears a chittering in the air, barely audible enough to reach his ears.
The sounds are coming from all around the room, but seem to be louder towards the passageway. Looking at the others,
Grindlefoot sees that they're focused on the guard and don't appear to hear anything. Focusing on the sounds, he
realizes they're actually words. "Eight legs. Dance in the dark. You know the dance." Looking up, into the corners
of the room, he becomes fascinated with the small webbing he discovers. He suddenly needs to touch it, to feel the
sensation of the web. And then the need is gone. The druid shakes his head softly, wondering what just happened.

Bilwin, ever the social butterfly of the group, quickly recovers, sports a large smile, and approaches the guard.

"Hail, friend! This is an amazing place you're guarding here. And that is a great trident! I don't think I've ever
seen such a nice trident. We're looking for our friends and we think they passed this way. Have you seen them?"

In their minds, the group hears the creature's response. "I'm Maltok and this trident is part of my duty, but yes,
it is a nice trident. Feels sturdy. It would work in battle. Yes, it would." Glaring at Bilwin and then
the others, "Are you here to relieve me or looking for your friends?"

Gven moves forward in a menacing manner to within a few feet of the guard, who stands at the same height. Staring
into its face, eye to eye, she glowers at him. "Yes, I'm here to relieve you, because only the strongest of us
can guard this area. And I'm the strongest one I know." She tightens her fists and the muscles in her arms ripple,
visible through the taut leather sleeves of her long coat.

Returning her stare for almost ten seconds, the creature suddenly shrugs its shoulders and hands her the trident
with the key ring still looped around the middle tine.

"Good, I shall go pray." And it lumbers off through the door the group entered.

"Shall we?" Gven lifts the key ring from the trident and looks to her companions. Dolor gestures towards the iron
door.

The half-orc unlocks the door and enters a large cavernous chamber, easily sixty feet from side to side in both
directions. A sizable chest sits on the floor along the north wall, with a gigantic club leaned up against the
wall next to it. 

Evenly spaced along the south wall, the group sees four cells. The first one, in the southeast corner of the
cavern, holds a giant [cyclops](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17090-cyclops) that barely fits inside its
prison. It looks at them with interest. In the next cell, an elf lies on the floor, not moving. A bugbear sits
on its haunches in the third cell, despondent and seemingly unaware of their entrance.

The last cell, in the southwest corner of the room, holds a figure wearing grey robes, similar to the ones worn
by the party they saw enter Web's Edge. A male drow, he looks at them through his cell's bars, an unnerving intensity
to his stare.

"You're not followers of Lloth." With a sneer, he rises and grabs hold of the door's iron bars. "Let me out of here
and I'll help you."

The cyclops mirrors the drow, also asking to be set free and saying they'll help.

Dolor responds to the drow. "How exactly would you help us?"

"Obviously you're strangers here. Those fake markings will only fool the dumbest of the followers, not those
like myself. My name is S'ril and they betrayed me. You search for something, don't you? I can show you the
way through the caverns. I'll help you if you set me free." His demeaner and voice are calm.

Bilwin closes his eyes momentarily and mouths a prayer to Hanseath before returning his gaze to the drow.
"You speak the truth about knowing Web's Edge, but you lie about helping us. You would lead us into danger and
a trap to ingratiate yourself to Lloth. You would betray us to regain your mistress's favor."

Gven meanders over to the cyclops, "And how would you help us?"

"I'll smash for you!" She points at the gargantuan club leaning against the north wall. "Mine," and she mimicks
smashing a club in her hand.

Studying the fifteen foot tall, one-eyed creature, Gven feels a sense of sincerity and believes her. "Do you have a name?"

"Gertrude."

As Gven unlocks the cyclops' cell door and opens it, she ducks her head to miss hitting a low-hanging stalactite and
stops in front of the half-orc. Standing almost twice as tall as Gven, Gertrude looks down at the half-orc, forcing
her head into a bow, and slowly closes her eyes for a moment, expressing her gratitude. 

Watching Gertrude retrieve her club, Gven loses herself in thought. There is more to this beast than meets the eye.

S'ril suddenly begins banging on his cell bars and yelling, "Prisoners are escaping! Prisoners are loose! I serve
you, Lloth!"

Bilwin sighs. A [radiant flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2236-sacred-flame) appears above the drow's head
and slowly sinks around him. He screams in agony while continuing to yell, "Prisoners! Get the prisoners!"

Dolor turns toward the shouting drow and raises his hands. A
[shaft of crackling white energy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619161-eldritch-blast) blasts from the tiefling's
extended palm, silencing the drow forever.

Through all of the commotion, the bugbear remains despondent and unmoving in their cell. Grindlefoot takes the
ring of keys from Gven and sets it on the floor outside of the cell door, within its reach.

"In case you decide to give it another chance, friend."

As the adventurers leave the room with Gertrude, Gven and Mond can sense that the cyclops is downcast. Neither is
certain why, whether it's her slower movements, head lowered slightly, or lack of excitement at being freed.

Feeling an intial connection with the cyclops, Gven asks why she is sad.

"Roxanna is gone. My only friend. Worked the mines together with many other
[svirfneblin](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Deep_gnome). Roxanna found out Lloth will attack
deep gnomes in the mines. She's gone now. I miss her much."

_The group has learned the secret of Gertrude, Lolth's cultists are planning a raid against the svirfneblin (deep
gnome) mining complex._

Gven and Mond attempt to comfort the mourning cyclops, both resting a hand on its back as they stand in the
antechamber, where they relieved Maltok from guard duty.
