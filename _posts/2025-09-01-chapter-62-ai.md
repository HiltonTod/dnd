The usual notetaker wasn't present for this session, so Bilwin took it upon himself to magically record the entire
encounter and its aftermath. Then the dwarf made the following prayer to a deity named Google Gemini
[NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/):

_Please provide a 2-3 page summary of the dungeons and dragons encounter. Include some quoted remarks by the players.
There are five players in the group: Gven is a half-orc barbarian, Dolor is a tiefling rogue, Grindlefoot is a
halfling druid, Bilwin is a dwarven cleric, and Mond is a half-elf sorcerer. Try to enumerate who is doing which
action and speech._ 

The prayer result is copied verbatim, including comical misspellings, absurdly emphasized words, grammatical
injustices, laughably incoherent quotations, and funny misunderstandings.

## Chapter 62 - by Google Gemini's NotebookLM

The adventurers found themselves in a dungeon chamber characterized by **difficult and dangerous terrain**. The floor
was covered with various sharp implements, including **"blades, or like. Swords, sticking up out of the ground"**, coils
of barbed wire, and other sharp objects. Moving across this floor was described as **"difficult and probably not without.
Uh, taking some sort of damage"**.

The immediate focus of their attention was a **"humanoid" figure** seated atop a slightly ajar coffin. This creature had
"dark pits for eyes" and "long and distended" arms that "flop out from around its body". The door opening seemed to startle
the creature, as it looked "ille as the door opens".

The players quickly realized the peril of their situation, with one remarking, **"Yo, why do we open doors? Oh, that was
a bad idea for me to open that door while I still. Right. The short rest should have happened before the door opens"**.
Following some initiative rolls, the order of action was established: Bilwin, Dolor, Gven, Mond, and Grindlefoot, followed
by the creature.

### Round 1 of Combat:

**Bilwin (Dwarven Cleric)** was the first to act, noting the creature was "at least about. 40 something feet away from me?".
Bilwin decided to prioritize supporting the group: **"I'm just gonna start by blessing everyone. That seems like a safe bet.
Yeah, like everyone needs some help here"**. This spell allowed everyone to add a D4 to their attack or saving throws for
the next minute, provided Bilwin maintained concentration. Bilwin also noted the room had "no obvious exits" and remembered
having "sacred flame, which is a cantrip for a cleric. Just does 2d8 at 60 foot distance". Bilwin cast Sacred Flame, hitting
the creature and dealing "nine points of damage". Bilwin concluded their turn by reminding everyone, **"Keep in mind that
they're they're blessed, but that's up to them to remember"**.

**Dolor (Tiefling Rogue)** was next. Dolor cast Eldritch Blast, resulting in a "total of 14 to hit," which "does not hit"
the creature. Following this, Dolor decided to "hide".

**Gven (Half-orc Barbarian)** was up. The creature was still more than 30 feet away, and reaching it would require a full
Dash action and navigating the difficult terrain. The spikes on the ground were "all over the place". Gven considered
making a leap, but given her strength score of 20, she could only jump 10 feet from a standing position or 20 feet with a
running start, which wouldn't get her all the way across without landing in the middle of the blades. Instead, Gven opted
to throw a javelin or hand axe. The throw resulted in a "22 to hit," even with disadvantage due to range. Gven dealt **"Seven
points of damage"** to the creature before ending her turn.

**Mond (Half-elf Sorcerer)** took their turn. Mond cast Firebolt, but the roll of "fifteen does not hit". Mond's turn
ended with the cantrip.

**Grindlefoot (Halfling Druid)** was the last player to act in the first round. Grindlefoot cast **"freedom of movement"
on Gven**. Grindlefoot explained the spell's effect: "the target's movement is unaffected by difficult terrain and spells
and other magical effects can neither reduce the target speed, nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained". The
spell also allowed Gven to "spend five feet of movement to automatically escape from non-magical restraints". The voice
of the game noted that Gven has frequently been "grappled, eaten", leading to a non-verbal exchange where Bilwin seemed to
question why this spell hadn't been used sooner, and Grindlefoot defended, **"I was a spider at the time? Yeah. Do you want
fuck yarn, or do you want this this?"**. Grindlefoot's turn concluded.

**Creature's Turn (End of Round 1):** The creature, described as having "kind of rope. BR" (likely referring to its long,
distended arms), attacked. One arm snapped out at Bilwin, but a roll of "12 does not hit". The other arm went towards Mond,
also missing. The voice of the game commented, "neither one hit". The creature then **"drops behind the, uh, the coffin.
Which is now giving her a partial cover"**, granting it a +2 bonus to AC.

### Round 2 of Combat:

**Bilwin (Dwarven Cleric)** started the next round. Despite the creature having partial cover, Bilwin decided to try to
hit it again with Guiding Bolt. A roll of "24 will hit", dealing **"17 points of damage"**. Bilwin then attempted to cast
a cantrip as a bonus action (Spiritual Weapon) but was informed it only has a range of 60 feet and the creature was
further away, so the spell missed.

**Dolor (Tiefling Rogue)** was up. To reach the creature, Dolor needed to cover 40 feet of difficult terrain. Dolor
decided to use 15 feet of movement to go into the bladed floor, and despite moving carefully, **"It's impossible for you
to avoid these blades entirely. And they cut at you,"** resulting in **"19 points of slash Advantage".** Dolor attempted to
use Uncanny Dodge as a reaction, but the voice of the game ruled against it, stating, **"this isn't a you're not uncanny
dodging an attack, right? This is, this is the environment you're in"**. Now 15 feet into the difficult terrain, Dolor
cast **Misty Step**, which carried them an additional 30 feet, bringing them right in front of the creature. Dolor then
made a melee attack. With the benefit of the blessing and the advantage from Bilwin's Guiding Bolt, Dolor rolled a 17 + 9,
resulting in **"27 to hit, and it'll hit"**. Dolor asked if this allowed for a sneak attack and was confirmed that "as long as
you get Advantage, yeah". The attack dealt **"11 points"** plus an additional **"13 points advantage"** for a total of
**"24 points"** of damage, described as "pretty sneaky, like no one was expecting you to run across a room of knives and
then teleport, and then just poof". Dolor ended their turn by hiding.

**Gven (Half-orc Barbarian)** was next. Gven decided to **rage**, which would halve any slashing damage she took from
the difficult terrain. With Freedom of Movement cast on her by Grindlefoot, she was unaffected by the difficult terrain's
movement penalties, allowing her to cover the full 40 feet. Gven decided to run 20 feet and then **"inspired by Dolores.
Take the jump action"** for the remaining 20 feet. As she moved across the bladed floor, Gven declared, **"fuck this shit.
I'm so goddamn tired and takes off"**. She took "23 points. Of slashing damage halved," reducing it to **"11".** Gven
then made an Athletics check to jump, rolling a **"28. Bam! Lands right in front of this creature with you on the other
side"**. Her action was jumping, and her bonus action was raging, concluding her turn.

**Mond (Half-elf Sorcerer)** wanted "to get in on the action". Mond cast Tasha's Mind Whip, requiring the creature to
make an Intelligence saving throw of 17. The creature failed, taking **"11 points of damage"** and was limited to only
one action (move, action, or bonus action) on its next turn. Mond confirmed that using a magical item (Vectored's Link
for invisibility) would take an action, but did not use it.

**Grindlefoot (Halfling Druid)** was up next. Grindlefoot cast **Moonbeam**, a spell that creates "a silver beam of
pillow it shines down in the five foot radius" dealing 2D10 damage on a failed Constitution save or half on a successful
one. The spell affected "creatures" within the area. After casting the spell, Grindlefoot decided to **"move and kind
of back out into the hallway that we came from,"** attempting to get out of the creature's "snappy arm range thing".

**Creature's Turn (End of Round 2):** The creature targeted Gven and Dolor, who were now flanking it, with a "deer
piercing Screech". This inherent ability was not an action. Dolor took **"Seven points of scientific damage"**. Gven,
despite raging, took "15 points a second payment" (psychic damage, which rage does not protect against). The creature
then made its allowed action, attacking Gven, but **"fully misses"**. The Moonbeam spell also affected the creature.
It needed to make a DC 15 Constitution save. The creature made the save, taking half damage from the Moonbeam.

### Round 3 of Combat:

**Bilwin (Dwarven Cleric)** was up. Bilwin cast Guiding Bolt again from a distance, hitting with a **"25"**. This
dealt **"six points of damage"** and granted advantage to the next attacker. Bilwin's Spiritual Weapon (already in
play) missed with a 14.

**Dolor (Tiefling Rogue)** was next. Dolor rolled a "26. First, oh crit". This critical hit, combined with a sneak
attack and the "gleaming blade" ability (which requires a DC 12 Constitution save or the target goes blind, though
the voice of the game noted it was likely negated by the Moonbeam already on the creature), dealt **"25 points of
damage"**. Dolor then used their bonus action to **"Hide"**. Dolor's total damage on this attack was 2d6 plus 8,
which amounted to **"17 points of damage"**.

The voice of the game then declared: **"She sits there bleeding. From dashing through the blades and leaping over
pretty badass, she just goes fuck. This and just Cleaves the thing in half, right? Greech. The creature. Splits
into".** The creature was defeated.

### Aftermath of Combat and Exploration:

With the creature vanquished, the party felt a "hint. Of really belief". The voice of the game revealed that the
creature was a "lonely sorrow swarm," resistant to slashing damage in dim light, but the Moonbeam spell had
rendered that moot.

The players then focused on the **sarcophagus**. Dolor made a perception check of "18", observing carvings of a
"Majorly well" figure (jokingly referred to as someone who "just wanted a hug") and the name **"prevented dominar"**.
More importantly, Dolor noticed a "white ish. It's almost like you see something some sort of liquid in the in the
coffin". With another 18, Dolor realized this "shimmeriness is very similar to what brought you to Evernote in the
first place". This liquid was identified as **"our crevice dusk. You found the way out"**.

The challenge was now how to get everyone across the dangerous floor to the sarcophagus. Grindlefoot considered
using **spider form** to "bring them over". However, Gven had another idea: **"My plan was just to have givan and
I pick up the lid and continuously throw it and break off the plates and wake up every time"**. Gven was determined:
**"Yeah, do the smash. I'll say the spider"**. Gven (with rage advantage on Athletics checks) proceeded to
**"decimat[e] the floor of this this room"** with the sarcophagus lid for about 30 minutes, creating a path. Elden,
the NPC they rescued, observed, remembering a past argument and commenting, **"I don't like her when she's angry"**.

Elden then confirmed the liquid was a "stable crevice". The group decided to leave, with Elden stating, **"You know
what? Fuck you and Pops in and monthly vanishes"**. Dolor followed. Bilwin then suggested marking the exit to alert
guards. Bilwin used Prestidigitation to **"soil the door"** of the building they emerged from, specifically spelling
out "Bad" or an inverse of "wash me" to make a permanent mark.

### Emergence and Encounter with Elden & Lord Neverwinter:

The party emerged from the crevice into a "run down" area. Gven, with a perception check of "three," was surprised
when Elden, who had gone ahead, suddenly appeared from behind a bed with **"surprise!"**. Gven instinctively swung,
but Elden was able to duck. 

They discussed the crevice, confirming it was a one-way passage, unlike the unstable one they had initially fallen
through. Elden offered insight into the "Dablendars" (presumably the former inhabitants of the crypt), suggesting
they were "cursed really" and that their "strong emotional. Energy" might have stabilized the crevice. He also
lamented that "the way out. Only came only became available after she died".

The group questioned Elden further about his capture. Elden, a scholar of "outer planes," recounted being **"kidnapped
me. That's all I have to say they didn't say anything. Nothing about nothing to you. They just put through you in the
the sphere. Started torturing. He's, like, yes, wow pretty much"**. He also shared a personal "secret" he overheard
cultists discussing: **"So, there's this Inn now. His daughter's love for me? Wait, this, what? There's an N, and
these daughter is lovely. And I really think that. Something else if he would just give us a chance like you could.
Our relationship. It really goes somewhere"**.

As dawn broke, two guards at the graveyard entrance greeted them, having been "told to expect you" by "Lord
Neverwinter". They were directed to return to him.

Upon reaching Lord Neverwinter's "makeshift" hall, he welcomed them back, noting, **"I heard that you rescued Eldon"**.
He then revealed that "a few hours after you, you went on your adventure... There was a bit of a. No ways of some sort,
and we, we, some of the gods, reported the the cultist fleeing". Lord Neverwinter then led them to a casket containing
a preserved body he identified as **"my mother"**. He handed Gven a "script" with "Van" written on it. The script read:
**"You move faster than I think. She can't allow for two seconds. Better looking? Food food"**. He hoped the party could
"explain this". The conversation ended with the realization that they had rescued Sarcel, Healthy, and Umberto, with
one more person (Ingrina) left to find.
