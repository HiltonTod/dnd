It's been a few days since the crew survived the
[young kraken](https://5e.tools/bestiary/young-kraken-lr.html)'s attack and the adventurers
are settling into their respective roles around the Iron Vulture.

Mond...learning how to navigate the ship. WRITE MORE.

Dolor...learning about the inner workings of the ship, given his background with watch-making. WRITE MORE.

Grindlefoot...practicing drunken style fighting. WRITE MORE.

Bilwin...praying and clerical stuff. WRITE MORE.

Gven...introspective since discovering that Torp is Davenor. WRITE MORE.

As night falls on the third day since they left Elsemar, Cap'n Don Karnahge looks out over the
bow, off into the distance. "There be a storm brewing. I'd bet my extra pinky toe on it."
Mond gives the captain a side-look of inquiry. "It helps wit me balance. Think 'bout it,
more surface to grip the deck wit. Commmon sense, eh." With an almost imperceptible wink
and smirk to Mond, the cap'n turns to the main mast and shouts up at Gven, currently on watch
in the crow's nest. "What do you see out off in the distance, there barbarian?" 

With her gained experience and because she follows the
[Path of the Totem Warrior](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior), Gven has adopted
the Eagle's Aspect of the Beast that allows her to see 1 mile away as though it were only
100 feet.










DELETE ---- CHAPTER 29 ----

It's their first day at sea on the Iron Vulture. They left Elsemar's harbor close to midday,
headed towards the mythical island of Amonah, although the harbor master thinks they're going
to the Northlands.

After a while, Cap'n Don Karnahge looks at the group milling about the deck and says, "okay,
there be only two rules ta follow on me vessel. One, don't fall off! Two, do what I asks
ye to do _when_ I asks ye to do 'er." They look at the captain, then each other, and back to
the captain with nods of their heads and a single enthusiatic "AYE, AYE, CAP'N" from Bilwin.

Grindlefoot casts [Water Breathing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/water-breathing) on everyone,
just in case something unexpected happens—which might not be unexpected given their history.

As they're sailing along, listening to the silence of the open sea, disturbed every once
in a while by a whoosh of steam being released from a pipe somewhere below deck, Gven decides
to tune her flute. Encouraged by the presence of a musical instrument, Bilwin brings out his
[hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy) and joins her. Unfortunately for the
others, both of them have trouble getting in tune and agreeing on a rhythm. It's not long
before even Cap'n Don has had enough and asks them to stop, with a reminder about rule number
two.

Mond is keenly interested in how the unique vessel works and asks the captain to show him the
ropes. He soon finds himself standing behind the ship's wheel, steering it to and fro with the
currents to keep it on its heading.

Dolor quietly observes everything going on around them, taking in how things work in his own way
and deciding where he can be the most help. While Grindlefoot can't quite get his sea legs
underneath him and spends much of the time at the stern of the ship, feeling queasy and
emptying his stomach into the salt water below.

With their musical efforts done for the moment, Bilwin brings out the old map that he bought from
Whichway, the [tabaxi](https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Tabaxi_(5e_Race_Variant)) cartographer
from The Four Corners in Elsemar. Cap'n Don looks it over and notes that the group of islands
they're headed towards are called the Pierced Vale. After The Conflict, those who refused to
give up their religious faith left Eritz and fled to those islands. He's sailed around the area
before and always encountered weird tides and currents, but he's never set foot on any of the
individual islands.

During a short break in vomiting off the stern, Grindlefoot notices a large dark spot in the water that
follows the ship for several minutes. It disappears for a few moments, then suddenly two large
tentacles erupt from the water and over the port side. Gven immediately runs over to them,
ready for battle.

Fight choreography:

<!-- Initiative rolls:
  Bilwin - 21 (nat 20)
  Gven - 10
  Mond - 13
  Dolor - 16
  Grindlefoot - 18 -->

<!-- Round 1 -->
* Tentacle 1 smashes Gven for 16 bludgeoning damage.
* Tentacle 2 crashes the side of the ship, but doesnt' hurt it much because of its heavy metal reinforcement.
* Bilwin awards Gven with Inspiration [add 1d6 to one attack role] and then is too surprised to do anything else.
* Grindlefoot casts [Call Lightning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/call-lightning) at the body of the creature,
  that's still underwater, but it doesn't have any effect on it.
* Dolor, rushing over to Gven, attacks Tentacle 1 with Gleaming Blade for 18 damage, but it merely bounces off
  the thick skin.
* Mond casts [Mind Spike](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/mind-spike) and causes 13 damage, visibly harming it.
* Gven invokes her [barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/)
  and is able to grapple free of the tentacle's grip.

<!-- Round 2 -->
* Tentacle 1 grapples Gven again, causing 11 damage.
* Tentacle 2 grabs Dolor and squeezes him, causing 18 damage.
  * Dolor responds with [Uncanny Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#UncannyDodge-347), reducing the damage by half.
* Bilwin prays to [Hanseath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hanseath) to bless everyone on the deck of the ship
  [add 1d4 to attack or saving throws].
  * He then casts [Spiritual Weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/spiritual-weapon), which hits Tentacle 1
    with 11 force damage and it seems to have an affect on the creature.
* Grindlefoot aims another bolt of lightning at Tentacle 1, careful to not hit Gven, and it doesn't hurt the creature at all.
* Dolor, being held by Tentacle 2, attacks the sinewy arm with Gleaming Blade, but it doesn't hurt the creature.
  * In a desperate attempt to do something, anything that might hurt it, Dolor slaps it with his bare hand—still nothing.
* Mond casts Mind Spike again, which has a visible impact on the creature and causes 11 damage.
* Gven, grappeld by Tentacle 1, swings her greatsword at the arm and it connects solidly but does no damage.

<!-- Round 3 -->
* Tentacle 1 lifts Gven high in the air, then brings her out over the water and raising it's beak out of water,
  drops her into its mouth. Completely engulfed, Gven takes 13 damage and is blinded and restrained.
* Tentacle 2 hurls Dolor towards the aft of the ship and he takes 4 in bludgeoning damage as he crashes into the deck.
* Bilwin, who just saw Gven get swallowed whole and Dolor be thrown about like a pebble, casts
  [Guiding Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/guiding-bolt) at the creature's mouth for 18 damage—that
  obviously hurt by its reaction. And now it's body and tentacles are shimmering with glitter.
  * The Spiritual Weapon sends a bolt at the creature, that hits the mark for 10 force damage.
* Grindlefoot grabs a long stick—not an oar—and casts [Shillelagh](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/shillelagh)
  on it then throws it squarely into the creature's large mouth, causing 6 damage and triggering it's gullet.
  * Gven comes shooting out of the creature's beak and lands in the water with a ker-plop.
  * "Damnit, I wasn't done yet!," she screams at Grindlefoot while suddenly trying to stay afloat.
* Mond casts Mind Spike again for 12 damage and the creature decides that this meal isn't worth the effort,
  leaving just as quickly as it appeared, back to the depths of the water.
  * For good measure and to teach it a lesson, Mond casts one more Mind Spike at the fleeing beast, causing 12 more damage.

Barely treading water—but able to breath easily thanks to Grindlefoot's forethought—Gven quickly grabs onto
the mesh skirting that covers most of the ship's exterior, not wanting the Iron Vulture to leave her behind
as it continues to make its way across the water. 

Still holding tightly to the ship's wheel, Cap'n Don calmly but loudly says "we're lucky twas a li'l one!
We'd a been in its stinky belly by now if it twer a full grown beast, but that wee
[young kraken](https://5e.tools/bestiary/young-kraken-lr.html) didn't care fer it's meal
fighten' back too much, now did he." With an ear-to-ear grin on his face, "Gods, I love bein on the
open sea, gits the blood movin!"

Dolor slowly picks himself up and shakes off the pain of being tossed around the ship, while Grindlefoot
and Mond come over to make sure he's okay.

Bilwin is quiet for once, visibly shaken by the experience and feeling something he hasn't in ages.
He's been faithful to Hanseath since taking his oath decades ago, but their relationship has
changed over the years. The connection has gotten weaker in some ways, like an old tunic's threads
getting stretched thin after being worn and washed over and over. 

But this time, Hanseath spoke to him directly. When he prayed for the blessing, he not only _heard_
Hanseath's response, he _felt_ it all around him. That old worn stretched-thin tunic was suddenly
a suit of [dragon scale mail](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/5380-dragon-scale-mail),
enveloping him in a sphere of safety and confidence like nothing he'd ever known. He'd never felt
that strong of a connection to his deity and it shook him to his core.

Slowly and silently, Bilwin moves to the bow of the ship where he sits in lotus position, with his
hands resting on his crossed legs, head held high, and eyes closed in reflective prayer. The
others are too surprised to know what to do and too respectful of the moment to do anything to
disturb it. As the sun begins to set for the day, they let Bilwin search for his answers in peace
and solitude.

From the port side of the ship's stern they hear Gven, "Hey guys, ummm, if it's not too much trouble,
would you mind throwing over a rope or something? It's wet down here and my hand is starting to go
numb."

_The adventurers advance to level 6._
