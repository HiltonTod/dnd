Standing in front of the entrance to the temple to Aish, Bilwin shakes his head in horror at its
desecration. "That these...these...heathens would do such a thing to another divinity's sacred place
of being is completely...unconscionable!" Without turning to the group, his earnestness is aparent.
"We must make this right."

Standing behind Bilwin, the rest of the group stares into the 8-foot wide open entrance with the
double doors swung open, seeing only impenetrable darkness. Curious at what might be inside, Grindlefoot
picks up a small rock and tosses it towards the doorway. Without looking away from the doorway, Bilwin's
arm snakes out and his hand grabs the stone out of the air as it flies by.

Turning his head slightly to face Grindlefoot, Bilwin grins. "We don't want to hurt the bees, now do we."

With a flick of his wrist, the rock flies over the side of the mountain and Bilwin enters the darkness
of the temple. Dolor shrugs his shoulders and follows. With a flutter of excitement, Gustaf hurries after
the dwarven cleric and tiefling. "Oh my! So much to see!" Only slightly less curious than Gustaf, Grindlefoot
skips off behind the archaeologist. Mond and Gven exchange a brief silent look of understanding—here we go—and
the half-orc motions for the sorcerer to go ahead, she'll bring up the rear.
