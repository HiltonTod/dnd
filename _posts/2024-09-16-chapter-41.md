As the group beds down for the night, Gven takes the first watch. The sun has gone down below the
treetops along the horizon and the last moments of twilight are hovering in the sky, when she
hears a soft rustling off in the brush. Listening closely with her hand on Tempest Edge's pommel,
she can tell it's purposely moving quietly, whatever it might be.

A moment later, a muscular [tabaxi](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tabaxi) slowly enters
the small campsite and looks at Gven. With a slight shrug of his shoulders, Nyx says, "I got hungry."

For just a moment, Gven gives him a hard look and then points toward the dwindling fire. "Plenty
leftover."

While eating a not-so-small portion of the dinner Grindlefoot prepared, Nyx takes in the others,
noting where they're bedded down for the night around the camp. Gven lets him eat in silence,
comfortable with the knowledge that he's not an enemy, perhaps even an ally. Ten minutes later,
the grey tabby-patterned tabaxi finds an empty spot amongst the others and curls up into a semi-circle.

Within moments, Gven hears a soft purring sound coming from that direction. She smiles to herself,
thinking about how good it feels to be with fellow adventurers who she considers friends.

Long rest....

The morning pre-dawn light is slowly grows brighter and Mond is enjoying a quiet watch,
listening to the mountainous jungle around them begin to come alive for the day. A deep rumbling
sound makes its way to them, seeming to come from the mountain they're approaching. Curious, but
not alarmed, the sorcerer decides to ask Nyx about the volcano.

The half-elf decides to poke the tabaxi with a lengthy stick, keeping his distance while waking
him. Before Mond is able to react, Nyx grabs the stick and breaks it in two, without opening his
eyes or moving the rest of his body. "Is that how you say good morning?"

Mond keeps his composure, trying not to reveal his nervousness at Nyx's speed and dexterity.
"Apologies, friend. I heard a deep rumbling and am merely curious about the volcano we approach.
Have you heard it do that before and do you know how active it is?"

"It does that every now and then, usually not much to worry about. The last eruption was over a
year ago. Any breakfast?"

The rest of the group wakes, eats a quick camp breakfast, packs up, and heads off towards the
mountain temple. Nyx decides to join them, at least for the day. As has become their habit on
the island, Dolor leads the way, with Bilwin and Mond close behind. Grindlefoot falls in behind
Mond, still walking lightly although without the thick foliage to walk upon. Gven motions for
Nyx to go ahead and the half-orc brings up the rear, keeping an eye and ear out for anything
that might be following them.

Several hours pass uneventfully, the adventurers walking quietly in single file towards their
destination.

Dolor and Bilwin notice that the hills they're walking amidst are actually burial mounds. Tombs
to some forgotten leaders, perhaps kings or chieftains or shaman. The entrances they can see
are framed by cut stones and the doorways are sealed with stones of a different color, setting
them apart from the rest of the barrows.

As they walk through the somber burial grounds, Nyx notices one tomb where the stone doorway
and frame has been blown apart.
