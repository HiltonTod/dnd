Having dealt with the last cleric down below, Bilwin turns to the rocky area surrounding him
and looks for the archer. "Come out, ya damned cowards!" Nothing but silence in response.

On the other side of the clearing, at the top, Gven and Dolor search for the other archer with no luck.
Using her [eagle eyesight](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior#toc2), the barbarian
sees nothing except for barren rock all the way to the treeline they left yesterday. It's as
though the archers vanished into nothingness.

Down in the clearing, Mond investigates the cleric whose clothes are not charred from fire.
The robes are very well made, yet purposely without any adornment at all. They don't carry any
coins or personal objects, only a small, plain-handled dagger that is also well crafted. The
sorcerer wonders for a moment if there's more to this group than meets the eye. Thinking of
their next encounter with any zealots, he decides that a little camouflage might go a long way
to not being their target. He removes the least harmed cowl, which only has a few minor singe
marks on a cuff, and pulls it over his own robes. It might stand hard scrutiny, but should work
in passing.

Grindlefoot is still invisible and decides to investigate further up the trail. He walks into
the canyon the zealots exited from and only twenty feet later comes to another decent-sized
clearing. It contains a makeshift camp with a few tents, an unlit campfire, and some supplies
strewn about. "Come out, come out, if you can." He waits for someone to poke their head out from
a tent, but no one does and he begins searching the campsite. The tents are sparse on the inside,
holding cots and supplies, but not much else. Amongst the provisions—only a few days worth remain,
not nearly enough to return to the port city—he finds medallions with the same symbol burned into
the shrine outside the small village and shown to them by the god, Zimon.

Finished searching for the vanished archer, Gven and Dolor see Mond alone in the clearing below,
rummaging through the dead clerics' clothing. The tall barbarian climbs down the twenty foot wall without
trouble, while the rogue seems to trip over a ledge of some sort and falls the last five feet, landing
with his face in the dirt. On the other side, Bilwin grabs a loose root and swings over the edge
of the canyon top, falling to the ground. As he reaches about halfway, the dwarf deftly pushes off of
the canyon wall, does a somersault and lands in front of the tiefling with a bow. "At your service, my
lovely horned friend."

Grumbling to himself, Dolor picks himself up from the dirt and walks over to the dead clerics to
help Mond search their bodies. He finds that each one holds a medallion in their pocket with the
same symbol as Zimon revealed to them. "Gustaf, it's clear to come out now."

"Ah, thank you lad! I didn't want to interrupt your discussion with these, um, rather intolerant
fanatics. Even for a man of knowledge, like myself, I couldn't stomach their obsessiveness."

Mond looks at the archaeologist with narrowed eyes, "What do you mean? That sounded like you knew
these zealots."

"Actually, I did travel with them for a bit." Seeing their faces turn angrier, the small man
holds up his hands in defense. "I had no idea they'd be here, in this location. Although, I did
know they were headed towards the temple. Apologies for not divulging that particular piece of
information. I was too excited about the prospects of what we'll see and sharing it with the world!"

"Spill it, Gustaf." Dolor looks perturbed, an unusual sentiment from the normally patient tiefling.

"Okay, okay. I wasn't hiding it from you, it just hadn't come up yet. Remember how I arrived at the
island by pirating? Well, none of them were interested in exploring the island, so I headed off
to the port city to see if I'd have better luck there. Turns out zealots don't mind company,
as long as you convince them that you're a believer too. As we were traveling from town
to the temple, I realized that they seemed short on supplies for a round trip. Posing this
question to the leader, that brute of a warrior Mond cooked alive back there, didn't go over
so well. When we came across those tombs and discovered the one blown open, I decided it was time
to go my own way."

Looking at the older man, Dolor says calmly, "You shut yourself into that room to get away from them,
didn't you. You knew they wouldn't be able to figure out the puzzle."

"You're smarter than she looks," and he pointedly looks at Gven for a moment. "I knew I'd be able
to get out. I just had to give them enough time to get bored and move along. But the statue was
so interesting, I couldn't pass up the opportunity. And before I knew it, you opened it for me."
