Winded and catching their breath after their encounter with the group of zealous knights, the
adventurers look around the room. Similar to the room they left, the stream floats through this one,
from the northeast corner to an exit in the southern wall. The torches on each wall illuminate
the chamber, showing it to be empty other than the corpses littering the floor.

Always prepared to take advantage of a situation, Dolor searches the unmoving bodies for any
valuables or information. The plate mail is finely made, even thought it's plain and nondescript, as
are their swords. "These zealots are bankrolled by somebody, or some thing." 

Looking closer at the leader, the rogue discovers a key attached to a cord around his neck. "I
wonder what this opens?" Continuing his investigation, Dolor discovers that the man's boots are
unlike the rest of the warriors' armor; they're ornately engraved with a swirling design that
resembles clouds or, perhaps, wind in movement. "And these boots are unique, as well. Do you
want to take a look, Bilwin?"

The cleric moves closer to the deceased leader's body, bends to the floor, and
[inspects](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2065-detect-magic) the pair of boots closely.
"You're right, Dolor, these are special." He closes his eyes and concentrates for a few more seconds.

"They're [Boots of Striding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4590-boots-of-striding-and-springing)!
Oh, whoever wears them can jump three times higher and farther. How fun!" Looking at the group
around him, Dolor, Mond, and Grindlefoot gesture for him to take them.

Gustaf asks, "What about the key, is there anything magical about it?" Grasping it with his hand,
Bilwin replys, "No, just a key. But I bet it unlocks adventures of some sort!"

Everyone is tired and wounded from the battle, plus they're uncertain how long they've been traversing
the temple's interior. Mond suggests that they take a long rest to recuperate—and he can regain his
spells. 

Long rest....

## UPDATE THIS SECTION FOR THE MAP

From the southeast corner of the room, Gustaf calls out, "Could someone help me up? This damnable
sword won't stop talking to me and I thought it might shut up if I laid on it!" The small man is
stuck on his back, rolling to each side in comic attempts to get to his feet. "Hurry now, I need to
update my map!"
