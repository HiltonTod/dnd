Slowly falling to the tree-covered jungle in the gorge, Dolor considers the irony of being
an agile thief and the only one that fell from the rope. Even that muscle-bound half-orc
nimbly scurried across the thin line. At least Bilwin had the wherewithal to cast
[Feather Fall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2095-feather-fall) so he won't be
hurt, assuming he doesn't land in a spot of quicksand or get skewered by some knife-shaped
tropical tree trunk.

Reaching the canopy of trees, the tiefling is able to navigate the leaves and branches,
landing softly on the jungle floor. It's oddly quiet here, much more so than up top along
the ancient roadway. There are a few unique sounds he can pick out, probably different
types of animals live in the gorge.
