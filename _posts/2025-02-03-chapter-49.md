Most of the companions are locked in a room, 30 feet square, with nine opaque globes hanging from an
unseeable ceiling. Mond, Gustaf, and [golem](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16863-flesh-golem)
number 9 are on the other side of the secured door, outside of the room and unable to help them with
the latest puzzle.

Dolor walks around the room, contemplating each of the silvery globes in turn. Bilwin joins him, but
neither discerns anything of note; there are no sounds from within, nothing can be seen inside, and
they do not move on their own.

Out of curiosity, Gven begins tapping each of them, attempting to generate a reaction in case something
is inside. On the fifth orb, she taps it a little too hard with her dagger and the glass shatters,
spilling several gems and a single key to the floor. Dolor picks up one of the gems, then another, and
says, "Pretty, but fake." Grindlefoot grabs the key and tries it in the room's door, but it doesn't
unlock the latch.

Gven continues tapping the remaining four globes, trying to do with a gentle touch to avoid breaking
them. The last one breaks open unexpectedly and several hundred gold coins fall out, along with
another key. Grindlefoot tries this key on the door, but it also fails to open the lock. 

Dolor does a quick count of the gold pieces, "600 is a decent sum for our purses. It looks like we're
meant to crack them all open until we find the one with the real key, and likely
a nasty surprise to go with it. Gven, do you want to do the honors?"

On the third orb, Gven breaks it open to discover a batch of jewelry and another key. Before they have
a chance to try this key, a cloud-like shape emerges from the remains of the orb and takes a human
form.

<!-- Round 1 -->

Seeing the shape become solid, Gven doesn't waste time and engages her
[rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/). Pulling
Tempest Edge from its sheath, she swings at the apparition tiwce, slicing through the figure's
outline. It screams in pain, a piercing sound that chills the barbarian's skin, and lashes out
with spectral tendrils that don't find their mark.

Standing close to Gven, Dolor is able to react next. Gleaming Blade arcs through the air faster than
the spirit can move, slicing through its mid-section. The tiefling follows up with his non-magical
shortsword in the other hand, stabbing the creature. Another shrill scream of agony fills the room.

Grindlefoot prepares to cast [Haste](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2138-haste) on Gven
and—fortunately, for his own health—recalls her response the last time he did. The druid decides
that Dolor will be more appreciative of the doubled speed, improved defensive benefits, and extra
action.

Before bludgeoning it with his [hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy) case,
Bilwin quickly verifies that it's not undead with
[Detect Evil and Good](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619090-detect-evil-and-good). The spectre
visibly recoils when the instrument's case lands against its shape.

<!-- Round 2 -->

##TODO

Outside the room, Mond carefully inspects the door, looking for any way to open it and join the others.
Mond plops down on the floor next to the golem, "Suppose this is a good time to update my map." Oddly,
the golem peers down at the small archaeologist and appears to be watching him draw.
