Dolor and Mond stand closest to the door as it continues to slide to the left, slowly
and quietly revealing a room about the same size as the one they first entered. Bilwin
walks up behind them, holding his magic stein higher and it illuminates the area with the
[Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618996-light) spell he cast on it earlier.

The room is circular, with the same hieroglyphics carved into the stone walls as in
the previous chamber and stairway. A tiny stream trickles across it, from one side to the
other, contained in a shallow pathway depressed into the floor. In the middle of the room,
the stream splits in two directions, forming a circle around a statue before rejoining
on the other side and continuing onward, beneath a low cut hole in the wall that allows
it to continue its journey. 

The statue looks like a gorilla, sitting in a meditative pose with four arms stretched
outward and hands facing upward. Its face is calm, as though it embraces its fate, to be
entombed in this crypt for eternity.

Crouched on one knee, holding a flickering torch close to the statue while inspecting an
outward-reaching arm, is a small human man. He's wearing a brown tweed jacket, with grey
patches covering the elbows, a stiff, high-collared dirty white shirt, dark brown wool
trousers, and sturdy, worn leather boots. Turning his head to get a better angle of the
gorilla's arm, his thinning, grey shoulder-length hair falls to to the side.

"Ah, that light's much better!" He continues his investigation for a moment longer before
turning his head towards the group.

"Hail to The One!" Seeing no reaction, "Okay, not zealots."

"Yarr!" The group reacts with quizzical looks. "Alright, not pirates."

"I'm Gustaf Mondalbrot, an archaeologist of the...what in the world is that!" Seeing a
giant spider hovering behind Gven and Nyx, the odd little man quickly hides behind the statue.

It takes the group more than a few minutes to convince Gustaf that they won't hurt him
or feed him to the giant spider. Finally, the spider realizes what's going on and leaves
the doorway. A moment later, a halfling enters the room, brushing past Gven and Nyx.
"What did I miss? Oh, nice to meet you, sir. I'm Grindlefoot, a farmer and connesiur of nuts,
mostly the roasted kind. What are you doing stuck in this room?"

"I'm researching, as any archaeologist of worth does. This statue represents Zimon, god
of the seasons. The construction is fascinating! You can tell by the size and direction
of the chisel strokes that it was created hundreds, nay, probably thousands of years ago.
And all from a single stone, which must have been exceptionally difficult for its worshipers
to get into this room. Oh, don't step on those pressure plates over there." He waves
offhandedly towards the door. "They close the door and I hadn't bothered to figure out how
to open it. I mean, the puzzle to get in here was so simple a child could figure it out in
mere minutes. It can't be that difficult a puzzle to get out of a room they let you into
so easily."

Most of the group, who spent hours figuring out how to unlock the puzzle blocking entry into
the room, look sheepishly at their feet. Except for Gven, who moves backwards and into the
doorway, figuring that she could hold it open if it tries to close.

Grindlefoot's curiosity is peaked. "What else can you tell about Zimon from the statue?"

"Great question, lad! You see how all of its hands are outstretched and facing upwards, a
common pose for meditation. Yet the god of seasons is not known for its contemplative
nature, so this seems unusual."

Mond looks thoughtfully at the pattern of designs on the walls around them. "Perhaps they
each represent a season and the palms are open because they're waiting for a token of each.
I'll be right back." He shoots out of the room and up the stairs to the outside, returning
a few minutes later with a leaf. The sorcerer places it on one of the gorilla's hands, but
nothing happens.

"Here's a feather," and Grindlefoot pulls one from his fancy coat then places it on one of
the empty hands. Nothing happens.

Mond casts [Ray of Frost](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618930-ray-of-frost) on one of the
two empty hands and it's encased in frigid blue-white light. Nothing happens.

"Hold on a minute here," and Bilwin takes his pack off his back, rummages around in it to
find a candle. With a quick flick of his hand, he lights the candle and sets it on the
remaining empty hand. It flickers uncertainly for a moment, briefly going out and making
the room seem darker than it should, especially with Gustaf's torch and Bilwin's glowing
stein.

When the candle flame comes back to life, the statue remains unmoving while also seeming to
lean forward towards the adventurers. It's unclear to them which is actually happening, is
it still or moving.

"You are not my followers, but you understand the rituals. Why did you call me?"



, as though reaching for something—or waiting for something to be placed in them.



A torch flickers
in the center of the circular room, illuminating enough of the
