## Backstory

We know that he's been a farmer all of his life and loves the land. That might explain why he's a
[Circle of the Land](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/515-druid-101-circle-of-the-land)
([Grassland](https://www.dndbeyond.com/subclasses/69-circle-of-the-land-grassland)) druid
with an [Outlander](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/background:outlander) background,
but we don't know why he's out adventuring.

History on Grindlefoot's martial arts ability (from one level of monk, in ch. 29) seen in Chapters 42 and 43 (and earlier, I think).

From Messenger Oct 26, 2024 (1:18 PM):

Tod: Continuity question for Grindlefoot (@Dave Holmes) - Do you have a staff or a club or both? Previously, you've fought with a staff, but you mentioned casting shillelagh on a club last week.

Dave: It’s a little bit of both. Shillelagh can be cast on a wood club or staff. Grindlefoot picked up a “club” before we left the city.

Dave: My initial idea for him was a farmer who had been made unwelcome at home because he used a little druid magic to give his farming a boost, and the world is anti-magic. 

Dave: So I envisioned him setting out with his pumpkin growing trophy and farmer’s hoe and not a lot else as a 1st level druid. 

Dave: The first time we rolled for initiative I realized entering combat with a hoe was silly, so I just called it a staff instead. Maybe a gnarled old walking stick. Perhaps the hoe head fell off.

Dave: Fast forward a bit and we spent time in the big city, where magic was even less welcome. Feeling a bit frustrated because he has these powers but has to keep them closeted, he began looking for ways to grow non-magically that still felt familiar.

Dave: I took one level of monk just before we got on the ship. Oh. Story tbc. I have to go fight a robot.

Dave: What I had been thinking with mink is how some martial arts (karate for example) were inspired by government oppression. People weren’t allowed to use weapons so they got good with hand to hand or farm implements as weapons. 

Dave: And then I thought about animal style kung fu. Learning to fight like a tiger/crane/monkey might feel natural for a group of druids who are used to literally turning into animals to fight. 

Dave: And finally, druids have shilelegh as a cantrip. It’s a natural druid weapon. And for some reason I got short stick fighting on the brain, like escrima. Short sticks are natural monk weapons too.

Dave: Sooo… the idea which I didn’t really articulate well, is that Grindlefoot was walking down the docks one sunny afternoon and came across a group of people practicing animal inspired martial arts, and the group included a large number of druid teachers. 

Dave: He trained just enough while we were in elsemar to earn his first belt/level. And learned to use short sticks for fighting. 

Dave: He still has his staff to travel with, but he also keeps a club handy when he wants to magic it up and deal with problems more hand to hand.

Dave: In the retelling of this I remembered that a shilelegh is a real weapon- like a thorny cane - and maybe that would have been a better fit thematically. Ah well. 🤷‍♂️

Dave: Oh. And I’ve been using the word club because it’s the nearest equivalent in the rules. 

Dave: If anyone has a better name for a short stick used in martial arts, lmk. Using a fancier name for it would be nice.
