Bilwin wakes up where he passed out the night before, lying on the sand at the edge of the glade where he
sparred with Gven. The storm is gone and the sky is clear, but the pre-dawn stars look different. He feels
a wave of water from the incoming tide wash over his hair and slowly pulls his arms up underneath
him, propping himself up on his elbows.

An older dwarf stumbles across the sandy beach towards the young dwarven cleric, holding a humongous tankard
that's easily half his height. He has a thick red beard, long hair tied into intricate braids, and
thick heavily worn armor. Lifting the stein to his mouth as though it weighs the same as a pint,
the seasoned dwarf takes a lengthy drink, easily spilling most of it down
into his beard. He takes a seat on a boulder close to Bilwin and, without bothering to wipe his face
of the leftover beer, gives Bilwin a somewhat concerned look.

"It's been a while, how ye feelin' this morning?"

With a glance back towards the incoming tide, Bilwin slowly says, "dwarves don't belong on water."

"Dig deep enough, and the mountain's always there," he responds solemnly. "Now, what the fuck are
you doing?"

"I, umm, I lost something and I don't know where to find it."

The dwarf takes another long swig from his exceptionally large stein, once again spilling half of it
out of the sides of his mouth. Wiping his face with the back of his other hand, he gives Bilwin a
stern look, appraising his still-inebriated state. "Well, y'er in no shape to get this in one go and
the others need to know."

With a flick of his wrist—or maybe it was a silent snap of his fingers, Bilwin couldn't quite tell
from where he was lying on the wet beach—there was a weird shift of focus around them and the others
from his party suddenly appeared, looking confused.

Gven looked at Bilwin, still lying on the sand, and then to the old dwarf. "Who are you?"

Pointing at Bilwin, the grizzled dwarf says, "he calls me [Hanseath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hanseath).
Let's mark the occasion with a drink." 

In that moment, each of them finds themselves holding a
pint-sized stein in their hand. Hanseath lifts himself from the small boulder he was sitting on
and goes around to each of them, pouring from his large stein into theirs. Returning to his
de facto seat, he raises his tankard towards them and proceeds to take another gulping
drink. Once again, most of the liquid spilling into his beard. The others drink from their steins,
each one smiling at the wonderful flavor contained therein.

"We should get on with this. Veylara will be upset that I'm here." Seeing their confusion, he
adds "no, she's not a god or deity or whatever it is yer calling us these days, but she's
one of the few mortals who understands and respects what we've gone through over the
millenia. She enjoys her alone time—quite the introvert, actually—and I don't care to disrupt
it any more than necessary."

Hanseath goes on to describe how the gods are a glitch, they don't belong to the natural order
of things in this world, Olam. Many of his kind use this to their advantage, gaining power and control
wherever they can. Others are less ambitious, mostly interested in living their life, not getting
shat on by the other gods, and helping out their followers when they can. After The Conflict, the
gods were given an ultimatum: leave forever and they'd still have some followers—and the powers
that come with them—but if they continued to fight, they'd end up with no followers—and no powers.
The first group is unhappy with how The Conflict ended and seems to be working on a plan.

He looks over his shoulder suspiciously, "something is going on and, I'll be damned if I
know what they're up to. One of us is stirring up shit and they need to be stopped." He
gives them a more serious look, "ye might _have_ to fight this battle."

The group looks around, noting each others surprise at the revelations and apparent resolve.

"Y'er three days away from the first of several islands. Amonah is the largest of them and the
only one with a large port city. Be warned though, that town's controlled by those who support
your opponent in Elsemar, Davanor." Turning to Gven with sympathy in his eyes, "I'm sorry for
what y'er going through, lass. People aren't always who we imagine them to be. Same with the gods."

Returning his attention to the group, "if you go to the other side of the island, ye'll find
a temple inside a dormant volcano. There be answers in that temple, and some history ye might
find...compelling. Your path, your choice. I've told ye all I know."

As the adventurers take in all that Hanseath has shared with them, Dolor speaks up. "What about
the symbol we saw in Davanor's warehouse?"

![B'raq's holy symbol discovered in Davanor's warehouse](/dnd/assets/images/ch28-holy-symbol-Braq.png){: .align-center }

"Ah, that belongs to B'raq, she's got a thing fer the sea. Specifically storms, the torrential
downpour kind that shake everything up, both above and below the surface. She revels in the
destructive power and damn if she don't love having followers. The more the better in her mind."

Hanseath slowly lifts himself from the boulder and raises his behemoth of a stein in their
general direction before taking one last swig. "Good fight to ye! May ye sing loud songs and
be drunk most of the time!"

Grindlefoot wakes from the dream to find himself slowly falling downward. The decaying webbing
that has been holding him up in the rigging of the bow mast on the Iron Vulture is gently
lowering him to the deck. As though he planned it, the halfling lightly touches the wooden
deck, brushes the remaining strands of web from his shoulders—with a little bit of difficulty
due to its sticky nature—and walks toward the starboard railing to check on his companions.

Cap'n Don wakes from his napping hammock by the helm, sees Grindlefoot is back in halfing form,
and runs over. "Can ye do that again? I have an idea! Well, lots of ideas for that butt-yarn!
That's great stuff, yer butt-yarn! But first, will you get rid of what ye left on the mast?"
He points at the bow mast, with the sails still pulled together and covered in webbing.

Bilwin feels a wave of water from the incoming tide wash over his hair and slowly opens his eyes.
Looking into the pre-dawn sky, he contemplates the dream they just experienced. As he considers
the implication of Hanseath speaking to him directly, well, as directly as a dream can be
considered, he hears Dolor. "What the...umm, why is the bow of the ship on fire? Oh, wait, it's
out now. We never should have left Grindlefoot alone with the captain."

The rest of the group wakes up to see Veylara walking towards them, from the top of the hill.
She smiles when they relay their dream encounter with Hanseath, not angry at all with the
deity's surprise visit, perhaps even showing a glimmer of joy. The storm giant agrees with
their conviction to continue onward and guarantees them safe passage through her storms.

Mond asks Veylara which of the gods have an affinity towards water and what she might know.
"There are several, but the two most powerful are Mayim, the god of rivers and lakes, and
B'raq, the goddess of storms and churning seas." 

Before they leave the island, Gven turns to Veylara with a serious look. "We are in your
debt, and yet I would ask one more favor. Your sword is a mighty weapon and I would like
to earn the right to carry one as noble. What service can I perform for you that would
gain me such a prize?"

Looking down at the barbarian half-orc, Veylara appears lost in thought for a moment and
then slowly reaches into her boot. Hidden within its shaft, the storm giant slides out a
dagger that appears to be the sister to her greatsword, with the same bluish-tinted blade. 
She easily holds it by the hilt in one hand. Suddenly, she flips it so that the hilt
faces Gven.

To the six and a half foot tall half-orc, the giant's five and a half foot long dagger is bigger
than her current greatsword. Gven slowly takes the blade from the giant's hand, holding
it with an obvious sense of awe and reverence. Gripping it with both hands, she takes a
few swings, exhibiting the sword forms she knows so well. The heft and size fit Gven as
though it was forged specifically for her hands.

"I believe that you will need this more than I in the coming days. Know that I expect it
returned to me someday. A gift of this sort creates a bond between us and requires a
gift in kind. It must be something of great value to you."

Reaching under her leather tunic, Gven retrieves a wooden medallion and hands it to Veylara.
"This was carved by my father and represents the bond of my family. It's not worth a
single copper to any tinker, yet it's priceless to me. You have my word that I will
return this glorious blade to you one day and retrieve my family's medallion, as we
share the tales of our adventures."

Turning the tiny-to-her medallion over in her hand, Veylara recognizes the Unwinking Eye
of [Gruumsh](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gruumsh). It's delicately carved into
a round piece of honey mesquite, a hardwood tree found in the grassy plains of the Badlands.
For safe keeping and decoration, the storm giant hangs the medallion from her left ear.

Bilwin says to Veylara, "I want to thank you for your hospitality and this opportunity to
reconnect with Hanseath. Please, drink from my stein. It will grant you a vision of something
that brings you joy." The storm giant takes a long draught from the magical mug and over
the next few minutes, her face takes on a countenance of calm and happiness. Handing the
stein back to Bilwin, "thank you, that was lovely. It has been a long time since I last saw
my home."

Dolor, Mond, Bilwin, and Gven return to the Iron Vulture and find Captain Don describing
something to Grindlefoot, emphatically waving his hands in all directions. "And if the
butt-yarn holds, like I think it will, we can make it do that thing I told ye about!"

The ship sets sail within the hour, the captain and his crew wave to Veylara as they leave.
Once again, she's perched upon the two hundred foot outcrop, watching the storm off in
the distance. True to her word, both the sky and the sea settle down around them as they
leave their safe harbor towards Amonah.

On the first day back at sea, Gven sits alone with her new greatsword, meditating upon
its place in this world and her connection with it. After several hours, she gains
[attunement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/magic-items#Attunement) with
the weapon, learning how Veylara forged the blade as a partner to her own greatsword and
the storm giant's experiences with it. "Tempest Edge" is its given name, describing the
explosive power contained within its precious metals. Once a day, as a bonus action, the
blade can channel the power of storms with +1d6 of lightning damage. On a
[critical hit](https://www.dicedragons.co.uk/blogs/tabletop-tips/how-do-critical-hits-work-dnd-5e)
it emits a deafening [Thunderclap](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/thunderclap) that
causes an additional 1d6 damage and deafens the target and all enemy combatants within
10 feet until their next turn, unless they make a DC 13 saving constitution roll. In
addition, the wielder has resistance to lightning damage.

Gven rises gracefully, holding Tempest Edge in front of her with both hands, and takes
it through a handful of forms. Settling into a relaxed stance, she looks at the blade
with respect, then turns back towards the island and Veylara, nodding her head in a silent
moment of gratitude.

Their second day at 



THIS IS FROM CHAPTER 9, ABOUT ATTUNEMENT TO A MAGICAL WEAPON

While the group settles in for the night, Dolor sits quietly with his recently acquired
shortsword to gain [attunement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/magic-items#Attunement).
He gets the sense that it's a very old blade and probably missed by someone. After some time,
the name "Gleaming Blade" comes to his mind and he suddenly understands it's history. It was
originally wielded by a [Paladin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/paladin) in their quest
for honor and glory. While being wielded, the blade gives +1 to armor class (AC), resistance
to [Radiant Damage](https://nerdnightnews.com/radiant-damage-5e/), and for true strikes
(rolling a natural 20) it emits a radiant glow where the target must roll a constitution
saving throw or become blinded until their next turn.

I THINK THIS GOES IN THIS NEXT CHAPTER

With her gained experience and because she follows the
[Path of the Totem Warrior](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior), Gven has adopted
the Eagle's Aspect of the Beast that allows her to see 1 mile away as though it were only
100 feet. Not even having to squint, she sees heavy storm clouds blocking the light and pummeling
the sea with rains in the direction they're headed. It's unavoidable, unless they turn around
and head back to where they came from.
