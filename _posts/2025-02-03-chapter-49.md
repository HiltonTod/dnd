Most of the companions are locked in a room, 30 feet square, with nine opaque globes hanging from an
unseeable ceiling. Mond, Gustaf, and [golem](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16863-flesh-golem)
number 9 are on the other side of the secured door, outside of the room and unable to help them with
the latest puzzle.

##TODO

Outside the room, Mond carefully inspects the door, looking for any way to open it and join the others.
Mond plops down on the floor next to the golem, "Suppose this is a good time to update my map." Oddly,
the golem peers down at the small archaeologist and appears to be watching him draw.
