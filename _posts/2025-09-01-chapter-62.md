As Bilwin and Gven look across the pit of embedded weapons, a humanoid figure emerges from behind the stone
sarcophagus on the far dais. It moves purposely with its head turned towards the two intruders. Where two
eyes should be are dark pits, from the slender torso extend long and distended arms that flop around its body.
It seems to have been startled by their entrance, even as it continues to move towards the front of its coffin.

"Why do we open doors? That was a bad idea! We're injured and could have used a short rest before
fighting another of these [lonely sorrowsworn](https://5e.tools/bestiary/lonely-sorrowsworn-mpmm.html). Remind
me next time, take a short rest **before** opening a door."

-->

<!-- Round 1 -->

Bilwin whispers a prayer to Hanseath, asking him to [bless](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2016-bless) his
friends during these troubling moments ahead. Looking around the room, the dwarf confirms that there are no
other doors and decides to cast the cantrip, [Sacred Flame](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618967-sacred-flame),
at the creature. Ethereal flames appear in the air above its head and quickly descend, causing it to screech in
anger and pain. 

Dolor enters the room in time to see the radiant flames descend upon the sorrowsworn. Making gestures with his
left hand, a [beam of energy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619161-eldritch-blast) explodes towards the
monster, hitting it squarely in the chest and pushing it back against its coffin. Still sore from their previous
encounter, the rogue actively [hides](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/combat#Hide) to avoid
being the target of its retaliation.

Entering the room behind the tiefling, Gven notes the pit of sharp weapons and distance separating them
from their foe. The barbarian grabs a javelin strapped to her back and launches it into the air, watching
it arc across the space and plummet into the creature's shoulder. It screeches in pain and anger at the continued
assault.

Moving around Gven, still on the western wall's platform, Mond moves his hands in a specific motions that Bilwin
recognizes. [Fragments of fire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618890-fire-bolt) erupt from the sorcerer's
hands towards the sorrowsworn, who manages to move behind their casket just as the bolt slams against it. Only its
head, shoulders, and three arms are visible.

Grindlefoot turns to Gven. "If you're willing, this spell will [help you traverse difficult terrain](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618921-freedom-of-movement) like pointy things sticking out of the floor."
The barbarian agrees to the spell, although she doesn't feel any differently after its done.

Bilwin looks at the halfling druid, "And this is the first time you thought to use freedom of movement? Seems
like it could have been useful, oh, MANY times before this!"

"I was a spider! Do you want to fuck yarn or do you want this?"

Mond shakes his head and says under his breath, "That escalated quickly."

The creature steps out from behind the coffin, to its side, and slings one of its arms wide. The arm extends
across the pit, barely missing the dwarf's leg. No sooner has that arm retracted then another shoots out at
Mond, also narrowly missing the sorcerer. Letting out another screech in frustration, the creature moves
back behind its coffin for some protection.

<!-- Round 2 -->

With only the creature's head and shoulders visible, Bilwin hurls a
[bolt of light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt) and it strikes the same shoulder
as Gven's javelin. To his companions, "The next attack has advantage!" An
[ethereal beer stein]([Spiritual Weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon)) appears
floating in the air next to the dwarf, but it seems confused and doesn't attack.

Relying on his rogue-like agility, Dolor decides to brave the pit of weapons. Although moving as carefully
as possible, he reaches the halfway point with several cuts and slices and blood flowing from the many wounds.
Shaking his head in frustration, the tiefling suddenly turns into a
[silvery mist](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619133-misty-step) and then reappears in front of the
creature holding Gleaming Blade. Thrusting the sword deep into the monster's mid-section and twisting it
as he pulls it out, causing as much damage as possible. Before it can react to the surprise attack, the rogue
[hides](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/combat#Hide).

Inspired by Dolor's surprise attack and counting on Grindlefoot's Freedom of Movement spell, Gven invokes
her [rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/) and dashes into
the dangerous sunken floor. The others watch as her body seems to slide through the sharp weapons unscathed,
until she reaches halfway and loses her burst of energy. "Fuck this shit. I'm so damned tired." With a large
step to create momentum, she leaps for all she's worth and clears the remaining distance to the dais. Bloodied
from that last step through the embedded weaponry, she lands on the dais on the other side of the creature
from Dolor.

"Let's do this."

From the platform by the door they entered, Mond casts [Tasha's Mind Whip](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:tashas-mind-whip),
causing the writhe in psychic pain.

Grindlefoot concentrates for a moment, and a pale [beam of moonlight](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2197-moonbeam)
suddenly shines on the creature, who is engulfed in ghostly flames. It howls in agony at the radiant damage,
the sound piercing and unsettling.

With Gven and Dolor flanking it, the creature lets out an ear-piercing screech that brings both of them to
their knees in psychic agony. During the half-orc's moment of weakness, the sorrowsworn lashes out
with one of her clawed arms, but it goes above Gven's head, barely missing.
