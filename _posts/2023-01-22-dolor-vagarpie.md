## Backstory


Dolor's parents, Amar and Alegría were well known jewelers and watchmakers, renowned for their exquisite craftsmanship. They roamed Eritz traveling the Ha-derech from Mirganor to Elsemar and back. They offered they skills acting as tinkers and craftspeople to the various communities and cities they encountered during their travels never charging more than they thought their clients could afford.

The family valued craft and artisanship and this was instilled in both Dolor and his sister Lucha, she developed her skills as a painter and Dolor focused on turning sand into glass. Both of them created beauty in their own way just as their parents did.

Eventually as he grew older, Dolor realized that some of the rich clients his parents created for would later refuse to pay the agreed upon fee, especially when they heard what other less fortunate people had been charged for work. This chafed him as unjust and it didn't take long for Dolor to realize that locks were much less complex than the watches and clocks he had been working with all his life and that he had a natural talent for being stealthy and finding ways into place he wasn't supposed to be in. These discoveries led him to "help" those nobles keep their word, even if they did not do so willingly, thus sending him down the path of the rogue and while the time his family spent in cities means he is very comfortable there, their lifestyle on the road and in the wilds while between cities made the Scout emphasis a given.

While he is still close with his family, Dolor wants to more deeply discover his future as a rogue and doing so while traveling with the family could put them at risk so he decided it was time to make his own way and discover his own path. 
This is what led him to be on the road that fateful day he met the others (and Ben).
