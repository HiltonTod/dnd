During breakfast, the companions are able to get a closer look at Skeller. He's tall, at around
6'1", and dressed simply in comfortable travelling clothes. During the discussion, they learn
that he's been travelling westward, from Mirgansor in the East, and hasn't encountered anything
odd. At least any more odd than he usually does. The townsfolk of Wayside, especially an elf named
Cindel, were eager to tell him the tale of the Chimera.

Skeller paused for a moment and sat thoughtfully, then said "I did buy some lovely flowers from
an amiable woman namded Prema. While I was in the Buzzin Bee, the townsfolk described the horrible
circumnstances of her husband and child being lost in the woods. Yet, when I spoke with her, there
seemed to be more to her tale than the folk realized...or maybe let on. I go the impression they
were a bit embarrassed for not being able to do more to help poor Prema."

"According to Prema, her husband was the most loyal, dedicated husband and father she knew of in
their small village. She knew he wouldn't abandon her or their daughter without something serious
having happened. He might not have been the best farmer, bless his heart, but he was a good hunter
and knew how to traverse the wilds. He never would have gotten lost, especially in these lands
that he knew so well. She's of the mind that they ventured across the river and the goblins got 'em."

The companions looked at each other in turn, realizing that they might not be quite ready to leave
the Wayside area.

Then Dolor turned the subject to another area of interest, especially to Gven. "Skeller, have you
any knews of Elsemar? We're headed that way, looking for a friend of ours." He then looks over
to Gven, prompting her to share as much information as she's ready. She goes on to describe how her
brother, Torp, left for his _Coming Out_ eight years ago and hasn't been heard from since, which
is extremely unusual. They ran into a rider from the Pride and Comfort in Wayside, who happened
to see a half-orc that looked eerily similar to Gven in Elsemar."

After describing the building to Skeller that the Pride and Comfort rider told her about, he
paused and rubbed his chin, in that way they'd quickly come to see him display when he's
contemplating his next words carefully. "I know of that building. They don't really care for
my type, or many other types, if you know what I'm sayin. It's a law firm run by a muckety-muck
who goes by the name of Davinor. He does a lot of work on the, how should I put it, seedier
side of the law. If your brother was in there and givin off the unhappy vibe that P&C rider told
ya, then my guess is that he weren't there for any reason to his own benefit."

The adventurers express their gratitude to Skeller, especially Gven, and decide to move on
quickly towards Elsemar. The city is still 5-6 long days of walking away. But they all need
breakfast and Xantic is excitedly cooking up his special "garbage omelet." It actually tastes
quite good, although no one asks about the specific ingredients.
