The group prepares for the night's rest after their campfire dinner and conversation.

"Why, Bilwin, my fine friend, what might that be lying next to your bedroll? The case looks
worse for wear, but it's what's inside that my curiosity needs to know."

"This," the dwarf moves the case so he can open it and tenderly removes his beloved
instrument, "is my trusty [hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy). 
It's gone with me through thick and thin, underground and above, in the air and on
the seas." There's a glimmer in his eye, "I'll take first watch for the night." He
begins to play softly.

Gustaf smiles, crawls into his bedroll, puts a black mask over his eyes, puffs of cotton into
his ears, and pulls the covers up to his neck.

Dolor is crawling into his own bedroll and looks at Gustaf then Bilwin. "I don't think those
cotton balls are going to stop the noise, but not a bad idea. I'll take the second watch."

The rest of the adventurers settle in for the first part of the night. Everyone is
surprised to hear a slow-paced and hopeful tune emerge from Bilwin's instrument. The
wistful melody permeates the area around them, causing each of them to smile for some
triggered memory or thought. Off in the distance, unknown to the group, a large predator
wakes from its day of rest, ready to begin the night's hunt—until it hears the soothing
sounds of the dwarf's melody, and decides that its prey can wait a little longer.

Long rest....

With the last watch, Grindlefoot wakes the others with the smell of breakfast cooking
over the rekindled campfire. Gustaf is the last to wake, but the first to speak. "Hmmm,
that smells delicious!"

"I didn't have to venture far to find some eggs, mushrooms, and berries to make omelettes.
I did hear some rustling off in the bushes that sounded like something awfully large,
but it also sounded like it yawned. Oh well, dig in."

After a short breakfast, they break camp and continue towards the mountain temple. Dolor
leads the way, with Bilwin and Gustaf trailing behind him discussing the different
geology and rock formations along their path. Mond and Grindlefoot walk in silence
behind the dwarf and archaeologist, while Gven keeps watch to the rear.

Several hours pass without any concerns as the terrain continues to change. There are fewer
trees, shrubs, and vegetation, and the land becomes more rocky and barren. The path leads
them into narrow canyons that gradully become deeper, the tops reaching twenty feet above
the ground.

Dolor exits one of the canyons, entering into a small clearing, when an arrow plunks into
the ground at his feet. "Far enough, what brings you here?"

Standing next to the arrow, Dolor looks around and sees no one on the ledges above the
clearing. "My own business. Let us pass and you'll have no trouble."

From a canyon on the other side of the clearing, a tall, muscular human man walks slowly
into the open space. He's wearing plate armor and a longsword in a scabbard at his side.
A few smaller soldiers follow behind him, eyeing Dolor and looking confident in their odds
of three to one.

"Who do you serve?"

Before answering, the tiefling sighs slightly and rests his hand on Gleaming Blade's
pommel. "No one."
