<!-- Guest player: Jolivette Shevitz as Dave Chevits -->

At the end of the fifty-foot long hallway, a wooden door is closed, with a heavy bar laden across
its front, preventing it from being opened. Dolor looks back to the others for approval
before lifting the metal beam from its place, securing the door—and whatever they'll find beyond it.

The rogue tiefling leads the group into a large room, 30 feet wide and 15 feet deep, that is ornately
decorated and lavishly furnished. Filling one corner of the room, is a four-post bed with a mountain of
sheets, comforters, and pillows that could comfortably fit four regular-sized humans, two half-orcs, or at
least six halflings. Along the west wall, an elaborate buffet, complete with gold filigre and
ornamental hardware, is laid out with all sorts of food delicacies and a fine choice of drinks.

Standing next to a leather-bound reading chair, one of a pair along the south wall, is a blond halfling.
Their hair falls below their shoulders, facial features are narrow and angular, slightly regal even,
and their body is slim yet sturdy. They hold two large knitting needles, deftly moving them while creating
what appears to be a scarf.

"Please join me. It's been a long time since I've had visitors. Would you like some coffee, tea, or
perhaps a taste of wine? The cold brew is especially fine, one of my favorites." She indicates the
buffet to her left, filled with liquid and solid treats.







Gustaf hurriedly updates the map in his leatherbound journal.
