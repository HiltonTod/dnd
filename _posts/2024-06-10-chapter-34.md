After their encounter with the [harpies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16919-harpy),
the group is ready to put down in the sea somewhere around the island. Based on their
reconnaissance, Cap'n Don provides some options.

"We cuid pit in at an empty grotto west o' the island, but the only way onto land is by
climbin' the steep cliffs that surround it. I cuid drap ye aff at a wee lagoon that's
surrounded by jungle, but it's too shallow tae harbor the Iron Vulture and I'd need tae
sail aroond while ye're aff adventurin'. We'd need a signal o' some sort so I ken when
tae get ye. Or there's a wee cove that looks tae be used by ootlaws, but ye'd hae tae
pretend tae be, well, pirates. Whit dae ye say, lads?"

<!-- English version
We could put in at an empty grotto west of the island, but the only way onto land is by 
climbing the steep cliffs that surround it. I could drop you off at a small lagoon that's 
surrounded by jungle, but it's too shallow to harbor the Iron Vulture and I'd need to sail 
around while you're off adventuring. We'd need a signal of some sort so I know when to get you. 
Or there's a small cove that looks to be used by outlaws, but you'd have to pretend to be, well, 
pirates. What do ya say, lads?
-->

The group decides on the pirate's cove, where they can hide in plain sight as pirates and
potentially get some information before venturing to the temple. Still flying in the air,
the captain takes them miles out to sea, in between Amonah and the other islands, where
they can land in the water without being seen. It's rough going—Mond and Bilwin end
up unexpectedly swimming for some reason—but the ship lands safely in the end. After battling
the harpies, flying around doing recon, and the rough sea landing, they decide to rest for
the night before making their way to Amonah.

Bilwin spends the evening in prayer to [Hanseath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hanseath),
singing and playing his [hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy). To the
surprise of the group, he sounds wonderful and some of them are entranced by the apparently
ancient dwarven hymns. Although Gven understands the Dwarven words Bilwin is singing, she's
unable to translate them for the others.

"Through my ears, his words reach my heart, but my mouth is unable to convey the reverence
embodied within them. They are his alone to share."

Long rest....

After a quick breakfast, the Iron Vulture and its crew are soon sailing towards the small
cove on the west side of Amonah. Approaching the island from the north, the inlet is so
sheltered by the rocky shore and overgrown vegetation, that they don't see it until Cap'n
Don is steering the ship into the hidden bay. A single ship sits in the water, 30 yards away
from a dock that appears stable enough, if crudely constructed. There are three or four
buildings around the lagoon, made of rough timbers and topped with thatched roofs. The other
ship, slightly bigger than the Iron Vulture, has its name written across its bow, the Emerald
Eye.

"Time tae be pirates!"

With the captain standing in the bow, the adventurers take their places in the dinghy and
row towards the dock. Soon, two male humans and a female half-elf appear on the doc,
calmly challenging their right to be there. With a few blustery words, Cap'n Don convinces
the Emerald Eye crew that he and his mates are also law breaking pirates, worthy of
entering this cove.

The Emerald Eye's captain, Al-Saryak, greets them with indifference and points towards one
of the buildings. "There's Boscoe's Bilge, where you'll find the man himself. His food
is tolerable, but his brew is downright satisfactory."

Entering the small building, a human man with a scraggly beard and patch over one eye
calls out to the group, "Welcome to the Bilge, I'm Boscoe. What can I do ya fer?"

The group orders coffee, while Bilwin is intrigued with the prospect of tasting
another brewer's concoction. Taking a sip from the mug provided by Boscoe, "My fine
fellow, this is deeeelicious! Do tell me how you created this wonderful flavor with
which even Hanseath would be enamored." The one-eyed man takes Bilwin by the shoulder
and leads him into the back room, where they have a lengthy discussion about the finer
points of fermentation in a jungle atmosphere.

The group is sitting at one of the larger tables in the Bilge, when Boscoe and Bilwin
finally return from the back room. He proceeds to tell them about the island, its
inhabitants, and how he came to live here—he shipwrecked close to this cove and
decided to retire from pirating to set up a small brewery.

The island is old and the people in the port town on the east side are true
believers, fanatic cultists in Boscoe's opinion. The rest of the island is wild
and dangerous, full of animals you've never seen that will kill you and plants
you've never seen, that will also kill you. There are a couple of shrines and
temples that the cultists make pilgrimages to, but they're mostly on well-trodden
paths. Stick to the less frequented areas to avoid the religious zealots.

It's early afternoon by the time they've finished their conversation and collected
some supplies from Boscoe—at a fair price, mind you. The group decides to head out
into the jungle while they still have some daylight. Cap'n Don rents himself one of
the huts, to patiently wait while his crew is out adventuring for gold and trinkets.
Off to the side, he quietly gives Grindlefoot a few flares and instructs him to
shoot them into the air if they get into trouble and need to be picked up.

Boscoe sends them off with a final word, "It's a beautiful island that kinda wants
to kill ya. Good luck!"
