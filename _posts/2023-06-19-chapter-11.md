The group of adventurers are standing in the treeline with Elar and Vera, just below the
open area leading up to the hill giant's domain. They can still just make out the large
beast swatting around in the tall mountain grass looking for the giant goat that mysteriously
disappeared.

While Elar is turned away, captivated by his daughter in the moment of their reunion,
Grindlefoot conjures some [goodberries](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/goodberry) for
the two recently rescued captives. They're both gaunt from lack of food and tired from
the stress, and the goodberries provide a visible benefit to their overall being in that
moment.

Knowing that they all need some rest after the encounter, the group heads back to Lyra's
grove. After a few hours of hiking, careful to leave as little of a trail as possible, they
reach their destination. They thoughtfully push their way through the blackberry bushes
that provide natural camouflage—and juicy snacks. Grindlefoot asks Elar and Vera to collect
some small firewood, allowing him to start a fire with his magic and not create an
uncomfortable situation. They spend the afternoon and evening in Lyra's grove, waking
the next morning, refreshed and eager to return to Wayside.

Long rest....
