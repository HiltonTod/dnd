With the zombie [tyrannosaurus rex](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17041-tyrannosaurus-rex)
turned to dust and the [yellow musk creepers](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Yellow_musk_creeper)
slashed to pieces, Nyx turns to the adventurers.

"Looks like my job here is done. Watch out for those yellow creeper flowers, they'll be on
you before you know it." 

Gven asks, "Before you leave, can you tell us how you came to roam this island?"

"I arrived here like most folks, on a boat. Despite my feline heritage, I was quite the pira, um,
sailor at one time. Like many ships on the Cracked Crystal Sea, mine ended up here. I'm quite curious,
probably because of my feline heritage, and discovered that this beautiful land in the middle of the
sea is hurting, perhaps even dying. I know what they say about this being the home of the gods,
and it probably can't die, but it sure is sick. Being a
[blood hunter](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/357975-blood-hunter), my particular skillset is
quite useful when dealing with monsters of all sorts, which this island has in boat loads."

He pulls out a long knife and cuts a mark into his arm, alongside three others. "That was the fourth
undead T-Rex I've taken out in the year I've been here. Buggers keep not-dying, thanks to these
damned flowers."

After all this time using his [spiritual weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon)
in battle, Bilwin has finally noticed the floating hurdy-gurdy next to him. Wondering why his
instrument is floating and not in its case on his back, he reaches for it, but his hand swipes
right through the ethereal instrument.

Nyx continues, "Why are you wandering around this inhospitable chunk of land?"

Dolor responds, "We're headed towards that temple on the mountain, looking for answers to questions."
With a brief glance at Bilwin, "We've been told by a close acquaintance that we'll find answers there."
