Slowly falling to the tree-covered jungle in the gorge, Dolor considers the irony of being
an agile thief and the only one that fell from the rope. Even that muscle-bound half-orc,
Gven, nimbly scurried across the thin line. Thanks to
[Asmodeus](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Asmodeus), Bilwin had the wherewithal
to cast [Feather Fall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2095-feather-fall) so he won't be
hurt, assuming he doesn't land in a spot of quicksand or get skewered by some knife-shaped
tropical tree trunk.

Reaching the canopy of trees, the tiefling is able to navigate the leaves and branches,
landing softly on the jungle floor. It's oddly quiet here, much more so than up top along
the ancient roadway. There are a few unique sounds he can pick out, probably different
types of animals live in the gorge. One in particular, a low ribbit, seems prominent
amongst the cacophony and coming from all directions.

Noticing that the croaking sounds are getting closer, Dolor rests his hand on Gleaming
Blade and stands still but alert with his sword in its scabbard. Within a few minutes,
five small-statured [froglike humanoids](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/lineage:grung) appear
from the surrounding jungle and surround Dolor.

"Hello, I'm new to this part of the island and looking for a way back up to the
top of the gorge. You wouldn't be able to point in the right direction for a stairway
or the like?" The creatures stare at him and continue to talk amongst themselves in the
rumbling ribbits. Four of them have green skin, while the one doing most of the talking
is red. They aren't wearing clothing of any sort, which makes it easy for Dolor to see
that their skin glimmers with a thin covering of moisture. They begin to fan out around
him, three of them holding primitive daggers.

"Looks like we're going to do this the old fashioned way, eh."

At the top of the ravine, Gven volunteers to rappel down into the gorge and look for
Dolor. Grindlefoot takes two lengths of rope tied together and secures one end to a
sturdy-looking tree stump. He yanks on it a few times, "There, I think that'll hold.
At least, it should."

He turns to Gven and gives her a sign to proceed, then decides that the rocks at his
feet are begging to be thrown.

## Fight choreography

<!-- Initiative rolls:
  Bilwin - 13
  Dolor - 24
  Grindlefoot - 14
  Gven - 19
  Mond - 5
-->

<!-- Round 1 -->
* Dolor - Attacks the red creature with Gleaming Blade, but misses both times.
  * Using an [action surge](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Fighter#toc_12), he is able to
    hit the red grung for 7 damage.
* Red grung - Emits a long "reeeeeeeeeee" in a rumbling tone and Dolor feels a resonance in his
  mind, but is able to shake it off.

---

While Gven is rappelling down the side of the cliff, Grindlefoot has set his sights on a rock
that's about half the size of his hand. He picks it up, tosses it into the air a few times to
get a feel for its weight, and then hurls it as far as he can out into the gorge. A few seconds
after hearing a satisfying _thwack_ from the rock hitting a tree, he sees a large swarm of buzzing
things fly out from the cover of the trees. "Uh oh."

Bilwin, not used to being the voice of reason, looks at Grindlefoot and says, "you _had_ to throw
a rock." He then casts [Locate Object](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2170-locate-object) on
Dolor's daggers. Because he's been practicing with them, Bilwin's developed an affinity towards them
and realizes he can use them to find Dolor in the jungle below. Shouting to Gven, "he's off
to the right!"

Gven, having climbed 30 feet down the rope by now, responds loud enough for the dwarf to hear,
"your right or mine?" "Mine, of course!" yells Bilwin.

Seeing the cloud of buzzing insects hovering over the tree tops, Mond prepares
[Ray of Frost](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2226-ray-of-frost) in the chance they
come this way.

---

<!-- Round 2 -->
* Green grung 1, 2, & 3 - Each attempt to grapple Dolor and miss.
* Green grung 4 - Grapples Dolor and rubs his hands over Dolor's neck, covering it with a slimy
  substance that it secretes through its skin. Dolor feels the venomous nature of the secretions,
  but is able to resist the toxic affect. The grung hangs out on Dolor's back.
* Dolor - Screams out at the top of his lungs, "I have a frog problem down here! Could use some help!"
  He attacks the red grung with Gleaming Blade, causing 8 damage, then follows up with his off
  hand shortsword for 8 more damage.
* Red grung - Slashes at Dolor with its dagger, but misses.

---

Gven hears Dolor's cry for help and hastens her descent, reaches the bottom of the gorge and
turns to her right—making sure it's the same as Bilwin's right—then hurries off into the jungle
to find Dolor.

At the top of the cliff, the swarm of insects approaches the group and Grindlefoot feels badly
about unintentionally disturbing their day. He casts [Speak with Animals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2258-speak-with-animals)
and apologizes to them, convincing them that it was a mistake and he wasn't threatening
their home. Surprising Bilwin and Mond, the swarm moves away to return to their hive, leaving
the group in peace.

Hearing Dolor's shout about frogs, Bilwin immediately runs off the edge of the cliff, shouting
"we're coming, hold on!" A second later he casts [Feather Fall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2095-feather-fall)
on himself and gently falls to the jungle floor below.

Also hearing Dolor, Mond follows Bilwin, walking to the edge of the cliff and then off. He looks
unusually calm as he falls, only moving his arms and legs enough to keep his body upright. As
he reaches the tree tops, he casts [Misty Step](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2195-misty-step).
In a sudden layer of silvery mist, he disappears from the leafy tree tops to reappear on the
jungle floor next to Gven. Without missing a step he says, "We can't let you have all the fun, now
can we."

---

<!-- Round 3 -->
* Green grung 1 - Attacks Dolor with a crudely made spear and hits, causing 5 damage.
* Green grung 2 & 3 - Attack Dolor with their daggers, but miss.
* Green grung 4 - Continuing to hold on to Dolor's back, he attempts to poison him again, but fails.
* Dolor - Slices the red grung with Gleaming Blade, causing 9 damage. He misses with his off-hand attack.
* Red grung - Attempts to slice Dolor with its dagger, but misses.

Grindlefoot feels badly about disturbing the bees and decides to make things right in his own, 
farming-focused way. He casts [Summon Beast](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/721187-summon-beast)
and calls all the birds he can think of that might inhabit this tropical island to him. He directs
the flocks of hummingbirds, parrots, and wrens to find all the seeds they can and spread them
throughout the forest in the gorge below, especially close to the tree where the insects hive is located.

He tells the rest of the birds, toucans, hornbills, kingfishers, owls, and tanagers, to go help
his friends; to attack whomever might be hurting them. 

Bilwin, still feather falling from the cliff's edge, looks up to see Grindlefoot standing tall
with his arms held out wide and birds swarming around him as the sun's rays rest on him like a
spotlight. "How beautiful!" A few seconds later, he lands lightly on the jungle floor and heads
off to the right, towards Dolor's daggers—and hopefully Dolor.

Mond and Gven are making their way through the jungle foliage towards where they think Dolor
is located when they hear the first sounds of battle.

<!-- Round 4 -->
* Green grung 1 - Hits Dolor with its spear, causing 3 damage.
* Green grung 2 & 3 - Attack Dolor with their daggers, but miss.
* Green grung 4 - Still hanging onto Dolor's back, slices Dolor with its dagger, for 3 damage.
* Dolor - Responds to the attack from the frog-creature on his back with
  [Hellish Rebuke](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hellish-rebuke) and the grung bursts into
  flame and is reduced to ash.
  * Tired of being poked, prodded, and sliced—not to mention several attempts to poison—Dolor
    attacks the red grung with a fury. He slashes the creatures across its chest with Gleaming
    Blade, causing 8 damage. Dolor quickly follows up with his shortsword in a ferocious off-hand
    strike, completely beheading the creature.

---

Mond and Gven enter the small clearing where Dolor is battling the five grung just in time
to see the one on his back burst into flames and the red one be violently beheaded.

Gven sees the three remaining small frog-creatures standing around Dolor with looks of terror on their
faces. She gives the tiefling a contemplative look, then a slight grin comes to her face. Moving calmly,
she sits down next to a tree with her hand resting on Tempest Edge's hilt, still in its scabbard. With
a nod of her head to the tiefling, "Carry on. This should be interesting."

Mond reacts a bit differently, casting [Tasha's Mind Whip](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:tashas-mind-whip)
at the three grung, immediately killing two of them. The lone survivor is badly hurt, but still able-bodied
enough to jump into the air and land on a tree branch twenty feet above ground. Within the next few
moments, it's joined by at least fifty of its brethren in the surrounding trees. Dolor, Gven, and Mond
can hear the ribbit noises of hundreds more headed their direction.

At that moment, a colossal swarm of birds swoops in and begins attacking each and every one of the
grung in the trees, sparing none from their beaks and claws. The large clan of frog-creatures quickly
decides to escape into the thick forest, leaving the tiefling, half-elf, and half-orc alone.

Still grinning, Gven pushes herself to her feet, "I think it's time to go now."

---

Standing on the cliff's edge, Grindlefoot casts [Plant Growth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2207-plant-growth)
at the area where the smaller birds have been furiously spreading seeds. For generations after
this day, the buzzing inhabitants of that hive speak reverently about the _Great One Who Spoke To Us_
as they enjoy the plentiful bounty that was created and continues to thrive.

After the day's escapades, the group returns to their campsite from the previous night. They reach it at
sunset and discover that nothing has disturbed the area, so they quickly settle in for dinner and sleep.

Long rest....
