# When rain comes to town



## Notes 


After giving away the growlers of beer, we go back to the boat.  

Long Rest... 

(Gven seems to have caught the stomach problems Mond had last week and stays on the boat?)


The big rain storm has arrived and it is pouring down in sheets.  Everything damp or soaked. 

The market is very subdued.  

(What did we get for food?) 

We Go to see Tella

### Tavern

Tella: 
Talks about how regulating / outlawing use of magical and clerical powers is what it is but magic everywhere (including people such as Mond) and the people still have an innate need for connection with higher powers of their choosing.
So there is a grey area. The Eyes of the Star and Hands of the Wand keep the peace.   Magic and Religion may not be practiced openly, but they are still there. 

Rightside says:
Sometimes we get sad. 
Mother had a medalion in the house 

Tella:
Goddess of charity - Sedocra - 

Red headed halfling still working at the pub:
Ro'qu-ell-a

University - City Center - Uphill from the doughnut shop
Prof. Verin - Aarakocra

### Out in the Rain

Grindlefoot buys a quality cloak and boots - So happy, best thing ever
Complimentary tin of oil to maintain water proofing

### University

Find our way up hill to the University and then to the library 
Stone construction

Up the stairs to find Verin in a class/research/lecture hall

Ancient seat of the all the pantheons of the gods of the modern world
Group of Islands off the mainland 
Turbulent waters and sea serpents 

Many gods, different for each  race, but the same story
Don't know what or who the gods are, but they are powerful and derive energy from worship.  Story goes at one point there was a hole in the earth from which the gods emerged. Made their home in different aspects.  And then they closed the hole. 

Map we found with the islands is in rough agreement with professor's understanding

Amonna, Ba-it, Kuht,  

Student, TA was interested in these talk, Dark hair, human, Julianne.

Crossbow imbeds in the blackboard near Verins head and we turn to see: 
* 2 Cloaked figures 
* 3 others in leather armor
