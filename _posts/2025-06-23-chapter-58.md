Looking around the room to see they're alone, Dolor eyes the robed corpses and investigates them
for anything of value or perhaps useful information. "Hand me that bloody cloth, will you?" Mond
pulls it from his [Bag of Holding](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/4581-bag-of-holding) and
takes it to the tiefling, who compares it to a tear in the bottom of an figure's robes. "Good boy,
Grindlefoot! You found the owner."

Moving to the leader's corpse, Dolor shares his discovery with the others. "This tattoo of a staring
eye on the back of their hand matches the painting on the door in the other room. They take this
seriously, like most zealots I suppose."

The room has three more doors they haven't explored yet, one on each wall, north, south, and west.
Figuring that they should start somewhere, Gven decides to investigate the door on the north wall.
She finds it unlocked and opens it cautiously, wary of disturbing more cultists. As the door swings
open slowly, the half-orc hears a loud click behind her and turns to see another robed figure enter
through the western door.

Mond also hears the noise and turns in time to see the mage begin to move his hands in a familiar
pattern, similar to the leader's recent efforts. The sorcerer is quick to cast
[Counterspell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619072-counterspell), causing the enemy's hands
to emit the tiniest spark. Disappointment covers his face when he realizes the fireball spell was
defeated before it even came to life in his hands. The spellcaster turns quickly and bolts back through
the door, shutting it loudly. The companions hear muffled shouts from behind it, "Push them up against
it! We can't let them get through!"

Closest to the door, Dolor pushes up against it, trying to force it open with all his strength and
is able to budge it enough to create a crack. Seeing this from the north wall, Gven bursts forward,
gaining speed as she approaches the wooden door and flings herself against it to aid the tiefling.
The door and those behind it temporarily lose the struggle, allowing it to open further, enough for
Bilwin to get an idea. As their opponents push back, closing the opening that Gven created, Bilwin
slides beneath the half-orc and tiefling to place his battle axe in its way, blocking it from closing.
Gven sets her feet solidly on the ground and with another surge of strength, the door flies open,
pushing back two robed figures and at least one wooden-post bed frame.

<!-- Round 1 -->

Following through on her mighty shove, Gven enters the room to see two robed figures falling backwards
from her forceful entrance. She stops momentarily in the short hallway leading into the room that,
with a quick glance around, appears to be a resting area with a handful of beds. She invokes her
[rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/) and draws
Tempest Edge, looking at the closest mage without any prejudice or emotion, only raw irritation.
She stabs him in the fleshy part of his midsection and then her follow-up attack is blocked by
an [invisible barrier](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619019-shield).

The wounded man is suddenly surrounded by a [silvery mist](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619133-misty-step)
and disappears from the room, leaving the other robed enemy alone with an enraged barbarian. Defying
the look of fear on their face, the remaining mage raises their hands and releases a
[blast of cold air](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619042-cone-of-cold) towards Gven and the
others in the doorway.

Even standing behind his companions, the freezing air encompasses Mond, chilling him to the bone
and angering him beyond comprehension. With the natural speed and agility of his half-elven heritage,
the sorcerer seems to glide past the others into the room and lays his hand on the mage's shoulder.
Uttering a few words under his breath, the sorcerer's hand shimmers and the mage writhes in
pain before whispering a [Counterspell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619072-counterspell) of
their own to stop the [vampiric touch](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619214-vampiric-touch).
Still, it was long enough to give Mond a bit of health for his efforts.

"Good, I see you've eaten your kale."

Picking himself up from the floor of the doorway, Bilwin pushes into the room and swings his
battle axe at their enemy. He slices through the magic user's robed sleeve, drawing blood from their
forearm and causing them to jump backwards.

Now behind everyone, Dolor notices that the first mage is behind them, apparently having
[misty-stepped](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619133-misty-step) to catch them off guard.
The tiefling turns and crosses the room, points a finger at the human and speaks words in
[Infernal](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Infernal_language). The magic user is
[engulfed in flames](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hellish-rebuke) and screams in pain.

"That's how you use fire."

<!-- Round 1 damage:
  Bilwin - 18
  Dolor - 37
  Grindlefoot - 18
  Gven - 18
  Mond - 37
-->

<!-- Round 2 -->

Still shivering from the freezing blast, Gven feels the anger rise from within, feeding the
barbarian rage she knows so well and focuses on the mage in front of her. Pushing from the
hip, she thrusts her greatsword into the magic-user's stomach, burying it to the hilt.

"Feel the cold death of hell." Realizing that hell isn't cold, "Umm, or something like that.
Just die already." The mage gives her a quizzical look as their eyes glaze over in death and
the body slumps to the floor.

Seeing the odds against him, the sole remaining mage moves to the center of the room, placing
himself between Dolor and the others. Once again, his hands move in a familiar pattern and a small
spark of fire begins to dance along his fingertips. Mond sees this and discerns from the mage's
location that he intends to kill everyone around him, including himself, by dropping a fireball
at his feet. As the flames begin to quickly grow, Mond casts one more
[Counterspell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619072-counterspell), stopping the deadly
incantation. The mage turns to look at Mond with pure hatred in his eyes.

Before the mage can react, Mond flings a [mass of energy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/14761-chaos-bolt)
at him. Immediately after being hit, the magic-user's face contorts in agony and his arms
undulate in pain from the poison coursing through his body. Within seconds, he falls to the floor,
adding one more corpse to the others.

---

Catching their breath and regaining some body warmth, the companions make their way to the sleeping
quarters where the two mages blockaded themselves. They find four cots, two are in disarray around
the doorway where they tried to block the door from opening. Two of the walls have several stone cubbies
cut into them, some containing old bones and others holding dust-covered urns. It appears to have
been a crypt before the current occupants converted it into a bunk room.

Bilwin enters the room, sees the recently deceased mage's body lying on the floor.
"Hmm, I wonder what these zealots are doing here." The dwarf looks directly at the corpse and kneels down,
"Hey buddy, why were you so cold?" Unexpectedly, the body moves slightly to look at Bilwin and mumbles,
_"We're in a tomb."_

"Oh my, I accidentally cast [Speak with Dead](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619068-speak-with-dead)!
Since I have your attention, smartass, how many more of you are there?"

_"A lot."_

"Could you be more helpful?"

The corpse doesn't respond for several seconds as though it's unsure what to say, _"Maybe."_

"Where are the kidnap victims?"

_"He keeps his secrets close."_

"Are we close yet?"

_"He comes...soon."_

Bilwin is only slightly frustrated at the corpse's unhelpful dialog. "What can you say, not like there's
much of a brain left in there."

While the dwarf was interrogating the deceased mage, Mond began inspecting the urns in the walls. Nothing
seemed out of the ordinary until he reached the fifth clay pot and noticed an unusual design on the front.
Rotating it to get a closer look, a portion of the south wall slides open to reveal a slight door. The
sorcerer pushes it open and finds a dark hallway leading to another door.

"Before we decide where to go next, I could use a short rest." Grindlefoot hops on one of the cots and tips
his hat over his eyes, indicating nap time.

---

The group feels a little better, having warmed up from the freezing spells, recharged with some rest, and
refueld with rations from their packs.

The halfling looks to the others, "Back the way we came to investigate those other doors or see what this
secret passageway is hiding?"

Gven votes with her feet, opening the previously hidden door in the south wall and entering the lightless
hallway. Reaching the end of the short hallway, she comes to another door and pulls it open carefully,
peeking beyond.

It's an average-sized room, roughly 20 feet across each way with three of the walls covered by bookcases
filled to the brim. A voluminous bed lies flat against the fourth wall and a large, ornate desk sits
kitty corner to it. A gaunt, older human man wearing a dark robe sits at the desk, intently reading
from a thick tomb.

Standing behind the man's right shoulder is a 7-foot tall, one-eyed, bipedal horror. The unusually large
eyeball notices the half-orc peering into the room. "Intruder!"

<!-- Initiative rolls:
  Bilwin - 22 (second)
  Dolor - 8
  Grindlefoot - 20
  Gven - 19
  Mond - 22 (first)
-->

<!-- Round 1 -->

Mond bursts through the doorway, pushing Gven out of his way, and raises his hands towards the two
figures. A piercingly bright swathe of [lightning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618999-lightning-bolt)
shoots from his fingertips and slams into both of the targets.

Entering the room behind Mond, Bilwin hurls a [bolt of light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt)
at the seated man, pushing him backwards in the chair with arms flailing to the side.

Suddenly a [silvery beam of light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619134-moonbeam) shines down from
the ceiling on the robed figure, illuminating him. He looks up momentarily, more annoyed than surprised.
"It seemed like a good idea at the time," Grindlefoot says to no one in particular.

A thought occurs to Gven as she readies for her attack. Could this robed man be one of the kidnap victims?
She moves forward towards the creature with Tempest Edge at the ready and turns to the man, "What's your
name?" He only sneers in response and so she continues her attack, striking the monster twice before it
falls to the ground. Oddly, it doesn't appear different than it did standing, as you'd expect a dead creature
to look.

The man sees what Gven has done to its protector and snidely says, "My name will be your worst nightmare."
Standing up and uttering a short phrase in an arcane language, he motions with his hands and everyone in the group suddenly
feels a profound coldness through their bodies as their internal organs begin to decay and a bout of lethargy
sets in. With another wave of his hands, four skeletons appear in front of him, shielding him from the
companions.

The last to enter the room, Dolor takes in the seemingly dead creature lying on the floor and four skeletons
protecting the mage. With a forceful thrust of both hands, a [wave of force](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2278-thunderwave)
sweeps outward from the tiefling that pushes the skeletons to the wall behind them, pulverizing them into scattered
bones. The mage is pushed backwards against the wall. He looks down at the one-eyed creature, mutters an
incantation, and the creature stands up.

<!-- Round 1 damage:
  Bilwin - 25 necrotic
  Dolor - 25 necrotic
  Grindlefoot - 25 necrotic
  Gven - 12 necrotic
  Mond - 25 necrotic
-->

<!-- Round 2 -->

Staring intently at the mage, Mond casts [Dissonant Whispers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619104-dissonant-whispers),
yet the robed figure doesn't move. He grins at the sorcerer.

Raising his axe, Bilwin charges forward at the mage. "Those skeletons didn't work so well, did they!"
Swinging the weapon, the blade cuts across the man's chest, drawing blood underneath the robe.
The often-present [ethereal beer stein](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon) appears
next to the dwarf and blasts the mage with its force spell, causing him to grunt in pain.

Gven turns to the robed mage and stabs him with Tempest Edge, turning the blade to increase the damage
as she pulls it free.

A dark hole, roughly the same height as the man, appears next to him. Mond attemps yet another
[Counterspell](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619072-counterspell), but it fails and the portal
solidifies. Visibly hurt, he says to the sorcerer, "Better luck next time...that you try...doing that
thing...you know, that you tried." And he steps into the pitch black portal, where it closes behind
him.

---

The group investigates the room, now that it's safe to do so. Dolor focuses on the desk, shuffling through
the scrolls, books, and papers for anything that might be useful. All of the papers have notes written
in the margins, seemingly intelligent yet chaotic ravings. He notices a few themes in the notations:

- The secrets and knowledge that people hold inside have a tangible quality that can be drained from them.
- A ritual of some sort, describing how to siphon this energy from victims.
- The first attempt to perform the ritual was on a cultist who betrayed their order.
- The phrase "Crevices of Dusk" is written repeatedly throughout the papers, referencing how they're
  magical gateways to other planes populated by the dead randmonly appearing in Neverwinter.

On the west wall, encased by a bookcase to either side, is a door. Dolor opens it to find a long hallway
that runs to the north and south. To the north are openings into rooms and at the southern end of the
passage is a heavy door. Bilwin enters the hallway behind Dolor and pauses for a moment, focusing on
something.

"There are screams coming from beyond that door," as he points to the south. Before anyone can stop him,
the dwarf darts to the end of the passage and opens the door.

The cleric sees a huge chamber, easily a hundred feet across and with a high ceiling. On the west wall
is a ledge, tens of feet above the floor with another one-eyed monstrosity standing calmly. Dangling from
the center of the cavern's ceiling is a spherical cage. Immeidately below it are six robed figures in a
circle, hands raised towards the cage while their voices chant in an ominous rhythm. Inside the cage is 
a terrified elf, the apparent unwilling subject of this ritual.
