After vanquishing the [gnolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16904-gnoll) and investigating
the [hill giant's](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16923-hill-giant) lair—finding quite a bit
of loot, much to their surprise—the group heads back down the mountain to Lyra's Grove. When they
arrive, they can tell that Lyra was not expecting, or hoping for, visitors anytime soon.

"So, you're back...again...I see. I suppose that was to be expected. Since the Battle of Wayside,
the other goblin tribes seem to have gone quiet and their other hidey-holes haven't been used.
I imagine y'er hungry after a day's fightin' and rescuin' loot, I'm about to cook up an older deer
the forest saw fit to provide us for sustenance."

With a brief nod and acknowledgement of its value and purpose, Lyra begins cooking smaller pieces
of the deer over a small campfire. Bilwin offers her a beer from his seemingly bottomless carrying
cask and she graciously accepts.

From his satchel, Dolor pulls out the box of delicate turquoise animal figurines. "We'd like you
to have these, if you're of interest, as a means of thank you for all of your assistance and
hospitality." Lyra takes the tiny box into her hand, slowly opens the lid, and quietly says, "we
rangers don't hold ta 'stuff' like them villagers do, but...these remind me of my purpose...why
I patrol these woods." With a look of calmness, Lyra pulls a small leather pouch out of a pocket
and carefully drops the figurines into it, handing the box back to Dolor. She draws a symbol in
the dirt, that looks like a letter U with a small tick going through the top right side.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#92;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#47;<br>

"I don't do gifts...but I do favors. If you ever find yerselves in a bit of a mess or tight spot or
just need the perspective of a ranger, make this mark somewhere around ya. If I can't get to ya,
then one of my brethren will know that yer a friend of a ranger and in some need."
