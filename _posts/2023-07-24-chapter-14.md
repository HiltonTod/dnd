Walking westward, Bilwin and Blauer Mond have been traveling together for a few days, not
necessarily out of friendship, rather, out of convenience. They happen to be headed the same
direction and there's safety in numbers when traveling the Ha-derech, as so many travelers
find themselves doing in these times of uncertainty. The two couldn't be much more different,
at least to the average passerby or observant. 

Bilwin, is a garishly dressed male [dwarf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/13-dwarf), carrying
a [hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy) across his back, and a mouth
that doesn't seem to ever stop talking. Meanwhile, Mond is a male [half-elf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/20-half-elf),
wearing non-descript traveling clothes and a light crossbow slung over his shoulder. Mond
seems to be ignoring Bilwin's constant prattling, until it stops and the sudden silence
reveals the sound of battle coming from the village up ahead. Apparently, Bilwin—self-titled
"the Magnificent," as he likes to remind everyone—is much more aware of his surroundings than
his constant chatter belies.

"Hold a minute, my hushed Half-Elven friend. Do you hear that? The sounds of battle are faint, but
coming from that village we near. Dare we continue our approach?" With a nod of his head
and a step forward, Mond gives his answer. "So we shall, my brave companion. So we shall! Tales
will be sung yet this night, indeed."

As the two travelers enter the edge of the village, they hear a large roar, followed shortly by
an undecipherable battle cry, and then silence. A few people begin emerging from a store on the
south side of the Ha-derech with a large sign identifying it as Bargain Ben's. They begin
whispering "is it over?", "are they gone now?", "is it safe?", and "do you think they're still
alive?" One of the villagers walks over to the local pub, apparently called the Buzzin Bee,
opens the front door and softly says "Hello? Anyone still alive in here who ain't a goblin?"
Bonnie pushes past the villager, through the Buzzin Bee's front door, and out into the street.
"The goblins have been turned away! Drinks are on me! Only one per customer though, so don't be
gettin yer hopes up to high, ya no-good'ers!" Trill pokes her head out the door, behind her older
sister, "and I get to stay up late!"

Bilwin and Mond follow the crowd into the Buzzin Bee, curious to hear more about what happened
here this evening. Bonnie hands an ale to three characters at the bar who have obviously been
in the midst of the fighting: a large female half-orc covered in blood, a male tiefling who even while
exhausted keeps tabs on everyone in the crowd, and a slender female half-elf with a
longbow leaning against the bar next to her. Bilwin pipes up, "where's mine, friend?" The half-orc gives
the gaudily dressed dwarf a side eye and grumbles, "Patience, buttercup, the grown ups have been busy."
Bilwin starts to redress the rude half-orc, but in a rare moment of self-awareness, realizes that the
crowd actually likes her and that he might be better off keeping his thoughts to himself.

A goblin walks in through the front door of the inn with a smile and a pair of pants thrown over
his shoulder—and not wearing any pants on his lower half. "I thought you needed your fighting pants
for the battle," the tiefling questions. "Never said I needed to wear them, eh! I heard something
about free drinks, Bonnie never gives us Low Elves drinks on the house." The tiefling raises his ale
in salute and asks "how'd y'all do over at Scribbles & Nibs?" 

"We got 5 of those bastards in the first wave and another 8 in the second, before we heard
what must have been Gven's battle cry and the rest of them started running for the hills. Well
done, Mixed Nuts! Oops, I mean huzzah, Chimera's Bane!"

Bilwin sees an opportunity, "Might I offer up my voice and my stringed instrument in tribute to the
great deeds done here this night? An ale or two to wet my parched throat is my only meager request."
The crowd roars in approval, except for Preet, who distrusts that any bard is even half as able as himself
in telling their tale. A few bars into the song, Bilwin stops to tune the hurdy-gurdy. "Ah, the dust
and wear of the road falls heavy on delicate instruments of entertainment and glory. Let me tune this
up a touch more."

The tuning—even two more attempts—does little to improve the hurdy-gurdy's sound nor that of Bilwin's
voice. He can't seem to hit any note in the right tone or length, turning his song of valor into one
of misery. Trill brings over an ale and quietly says "you can have as many of these as you like, as long
as you stop playing and singing." Whispers from the crowd can be heard: "Do you think he was trying
to sound like the giant dying? Maybe he was being ironic, like a hypester? I don't do irony, those
arrogant pricks."

Long rest....
