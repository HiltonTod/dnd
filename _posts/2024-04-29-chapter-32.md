Bilwin wakes up where he passed out the night before, at the edge of the glade where he sparred
with Gven. The storm is gone and the sky is clear, but the pre-dawn stars look different. He feels
a wave of water from the incoming tide wash over his hair and slowly pulls his arms up underneath
him, propping himself up on his elbows.

An older dwarf stumbles across the sandy beach towards the young cleric, holding a humongous tankard,
that's easily half his height. He has a thick red beard, long hair tied into intricate braids, and
thick, heavily worn armor. Lifting the stein to his mouth as though it weighs the same as a pint,
the seasoned dwarf takes a lengthy drink, easily spilling most of it down the sides of his mouth,
into his beard. He takes a seat on a boulder close to Bilwin and, without bothering to wipe his face
of the leftover beer, gives Bilwin a somewhat disapproving look.

"It's been a while, how ye feelin' this morning?"

With a look back towards the incoming tide, Bilwin slowly says, "dwarves don't belong on water."

"Dig deep enough, and the mountain's always there," he responds solemnly. "Now, what the fuck are
you doing?"

"I, umm, I lost something and I don't know where to find it."

The dwarf takes another long swig from his exceptionally large stein, once again spilling half of it
out of the sides of his mouth. Wiping his face with the back of his other hand, he give Bilwin a
stern look. "Well, y'er in no shape to get this in one go and the others need to know."

With a flick of his wrist—or maybe it was a silent snap of his fingers, Bilwin couldn't quite tell
from where he was lying on the wet beach—there was a weird shift of focus around them and the others
from his party suddenly appeared, looking confused.

Gven looked at Bilwin, still lying on the sand, and then to the old dwarf. "Who are you?"

Pointing at Bilwin, the grizzled dwarf says, "he calls me [Hanseath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hanseath).
Let's mark the occasion with a drink." In that moment, each of them finds themselves holding a
pint-sized stein in their hand. Hanseath lifts himself from the small boulder he was sitting on
and goes around to each of them, pouring from his large stein into theirs. Returning to his
de facto seat, he raises his tankard towards them, and then proceeds to take another gulping
drink, with most of the liquid spilling into his beard. The others drink from their steins, each
one smiling at the wonderful flavor contained therein.





THIS IS FROM CHAPTER 9, ABOUT ATTUNEMENT TO A MAGICAL WEAPON

While the group settles in for the night, Dolor sits quietly with his recently acquired
shortsword to gain [attunement](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/magic-items#Attunement).
He gets the sense that it's a very old blade and probably missed by someone. After some time,
the name "Gleaming Blade" comes to his mind and he suddenly understands it's history. It was
originally wielded by a [Paladin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/paladin) in their quest
for honor and glory. While being wielded, the blade gives +1 to armor class (AC), resistance
to [Radiant Damage](https://nerdnightnews.com/radiant-damage-5e/), and for true strikes
(rolling a natural 20) it emits a radiant glow where the target must roll a constitution
saving throw or become blinded until their next turn.

I THINK THIS GOES IN THIS NEXT CHAPTER

With her gained experience and because she follows the
[Path of the Totem Warrior](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior), Gven has adopted
the Eagle's Aspect of the Beast that allows her to see 1 mile away as though it were only
100 feet. Not even having to squint, she sees heavy storm clouds blocking the light and pummeling
the sea with rains in the direction they're headed. It's unavoidable, unless they turn around
and head back to where they came from.
