Facing the two crew members, one with her greatsword drawn and anticipating a problem, Bilwin reaches into a
pocket, pulls out two breakfast rolls and tosses them at the end of the sword. The first roll bounces off the
tip of the sword and falls to the ground, while the second one misses the blade and boinks the sailor in the
forehead.

Before she can react to the doughy assault, her companion snickers loud enough for the group to hear, "I don't
suppose you'd be attacking us with baked goods if you really meant us harm." 

The two of them glance at Tempest Edge strapped across Gven's back, Gleaming Blade in its sheath at Dolor's hip,
and then each of the others, assessing their readiness for combat. She lowers her sword as Bilwin giggles,
picks up the rolls, and takes a bite of one. "No waste for the weary. At least, I think that's what they say."

The tall female's patience is obviously wearing thin, "Again, what brings you to the Lambent Zenith?"

Before the companions can contrive a story, Dolor decides to go with the truth. Below the tiefling's horns, his
pointed ears twitch slightly, "We're trying to find a piece of a magical rod that will help us stop Vecna—a
narcacisstic demi-god of some sort—from destroying our world, all worlds really. The latest clue led us here,
to this ship."

The male looks at his companion for a moment and something unspoken passes between them. "I'm Zastra and this is
Lysan. I can't imagine anyone one in their right mind leading with that story if it weren't true. Not sure what
we can do for you, though. We don't have any magical rods hanging about."

Dolor's tail begins to rhythmically swish back and forth, like a slow metronome. "I can appreciate that, and yet,
your ship is our only lead. Can you tell us how the ship came to be here and in this," he gestures around the
deck where two thirds of the ship is missing, "predicament?"

"We were traveling the Astral Sea, like any other day, and set upon by a fever of
[cloakers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16826-cloaker). Damnable beasts with arms that look like wings on 
either side of their flat, wide body, and pointy barbs along their six-foot tail. That isn't so unusual, in and of
itself, but during the battle some sort of massive energy burst tore the ship into three pieces." He stops and thinks
to himself for a moment, "Hmm, now that you pose the question, that does seem coincidental. During our travels,
Captain Inda came across some magical item that she harnessed to power the ship. And it worked, too." He scratches
his chin, "Perhaps a little too well. The ship's pieces, with us clinging to them, fell to this forsaken god's body,
and it's where we've been ever since. That was two, maybe three months ago. We've tried to venture out into the
stony terrain you see around us, but there are some vicious creatures all about. Haven't been able to check in
with the crew who were in the other parts of the ship. No idea if they're alive, like us, died in the crash,
or became a meal for the unnatural beasts roaming around." He shrugs his shoulders in resignation.

Moving in closer from the edge of the group, Grindlefoot looks to Zastran, "What's your captain's plan? Surely
they haven't been sitting around doing nothing this whole time."

"Ah, the captain isn't on this part of the ship. We hope she's still alive on one of the other pieces, but Illren is
running things around here. He's actually the quartermaster. Our first mate, Figaro, has been sick ever since we laid
eyes, and feet, on this damnable stony hunk of a dead god. As to a plan," he glances at Lysan, "Illren's not too keen on
logistics, keeps saying wait for the captain to come to us. Speaking of, I'll go find him. Wait here."

The slender humanoid leaves them on the ship's deck under the careful watch of Lysan. Within a few short minutes,
he returns with an even taller creature, easily over eight feet at the tip of its large head. They wear a
hip-length coat constructed of red velvet that must have a stretchiness to it, because it's bulging at the seams
from the enormous arms contained within. The deck thuds loudly with each step of the massive humanoid
[hippopotami]((https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Giff)).

"Ho, visitors! And ones who aren't trying to eat us! What a beautiful day! I'm Illren, the acting captain since our
first mate is feeling a little under the weather. Zastran here tells me you're on a quest. That's a thing we can
always get behind. What can I do for you fine folks?"

Dolor retells their tale with a few more details and then asks, "What ails your first mate? Both our cleric and druid
might be able to help?"

The large hippopotami glances at Gven and her sheathed greatsword before answering, "We don't rightly know. He's
locked himself in the captain's cabin and won't come out. Goes on telling me to 'keep things afloat while I rest
up and don't bother me.' We take him at his word, leaving him to hisself."

"What about the other parts of the ship and the crew?" Gven prompts Illren and the others, "You say that you've
tried to venture out into the surrounding area, but met resistance. Can you see them from here? Is there a way to
communicate with them?"

Zastra is the first to respond, "We can take care of ourselves when we need to, but them creatures out there are
something out of a legend or nightmare. The other ships are too far away to yell at or hear and we can barely make
them out from the top of the mast."

Considering her [eagle eyesight](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior#toc2), Gven asks the Githyanki,
"Can you take me up for a look? I have a certain advantage seeing things at a distance."

Zastra gestures towards the main mast and moves that way with Gven close in tow. They both quickly scramble up the
main stick, and the sailor's look reveals a newfound respect for the barbarian's agility. Reaching the crow's nest,
Gven can now see the stony terrain with trees, bushes, and all sorts of foliage that appears to be made of stone.
Several small waterways meander across the landscape and are solidified liquid, as though frozen in a moment of time.

Zastra points to the southwest, "There's the prow—that's the very front of the ship. Not sure if you're a sailor or
landlubber," he follows up with as a means of apologizing for the explanation.

"Mostly the latter, but I've spent some time on the water, and in the air." She smiles a bit at the thought of
Cap'n Don Karnahge and their time on his flying ship, the Iron Vulture.

"Over there," he points to the southeast, "that's the starboard side of vessel. Everything else broke up into smaller
pieces than we can see from here."

Looking in both directions, the crashed pieces are well within the 1 mile limit of her eyesight, but the terrain
and foliage hide most everything from view. "I can see them clearly, but they're too obscured to see anything useful."

The half-orc's neck begins to tingle and she notices that Zastra is fidgety. "Something on your mind, friend? This group
of ours often finds ourselves in unique positions where we can help folks. Whether it's the gods or fate, I can't say,
but that seems to be the way of things."

The sailor speaks in a low whisper, even though they're more than 40 feet above the others down on the deck.
"Your halfling friend has the right of things, the captain would have had a plan by now. Same for Figaro, the first
mate. But without the captain around and the first mate sick, Illren seems content to keep us here. He's the only
one who speaks with Figaro, says that he needs rest and will be better soon. My instincts don't like it. Things don't
seem right. Figaro started feeling sick shortly after we crashed here on this damn thing and hasn't spoken to anyone
but Illren since. Things just don't seem right to me." He shifts nervously, "We better get back to the deck. Illren
acts one way and behaves another."

Gven and Zastra reach the main deck a few minutes later, after an uneventful climb down. With an unexpected guffaw,
Illren gives the companions free reign of the ship. "You're welcome aboard the Lambent Zenith! I have duties to attend
to, but feel free to explore this fine vessel and make use of what you need. Thankfully, eating isn't necessary in
the Astral Plane, so we still have plenty of stores."

Dolor looks to his companions for confirmation, "We can attempt the journey to the other parts of the wreck, but we'd
like to take a look around and talk to some of the crew first, if that's acceptable."

The immense sailor replies with a hearty, "By all means, we'd be in your debt!"

Following Illren, the companions enter the door he exited before meeting them. A narrow staircase leads to the lower deck.
Traversing the steps carefully, they enter the mess room where a half-elf sits at a table alone, playing some sort of
card game. He glances their direction, noting their existence, but nothing more. Through an open door, they see a
burly female orc puttering around the galley. She takes more interest, turning to look at them directly with an
expectant look on her face.

From the top deck, Zastra calls out for Illren. The acting captain makes his excuses and returns up the stairs.
Gven looks to Grindlefoot and shakes her head a few times towards the steps, silently asking him to follow Illren
and find out if anything weird is going on with the overly happy hippo. The halfling quietly ascends the stairs,
leaving his comrades behind.

Mond approaches the orc, close to a foot taller than the half-elf. "Hello. We were granted leave to peruse the ship
by Illren. Perhaps you can help us find something, which might also help resolve your current situation." He extends
his hand in greeting, "My name is Mond."

She acknowledges his greeting and the firmness of her gaze softens, "You can call me Kycera. We could use some help
getting off this bloody rock."

"We're looking for a magical item, a piece broken from a rod. Do you know of anything like that on the ship?"

"I don't know about any magical rod, but I know our captain had a rare, powerful artifact that she was using to power
the ship. She asked me to secure it, which I did with magical wards. The artifact is in a safe room in the prow of the
ship, most likely where the captain can be found, that is," she rolls her eyes, "if we were ever bold enough to venture
out of this floating tube. Anyway, the wards are powered by two runes, one in the state room on this part of the wreckage
and the other in a starboard room."

Mond thinks for a moment, "The state room, is that where your first mate is recuperating from an illness?" Kycera
nods her head, answering his question.

"May we go see your first mate? Figaro, I believe, right? Our druid might be able to help him." 

Again, she nods her head, "The room and Figaro are down those stairs, second door on your left." Her voice drops
to just above a whisper, "Be quick and be quiet. I doubt Illren would much like you poking around down there and
disturbing Figaro."

As Dolor leads Mond and Gven down to the next leverl, Bilwin enters the galley. "Any good beer on this fine vessel?
I could use a drink!" 

Kycera looks down at the dwarf, whose head comes to her waist, and grins. "You know that you don't need to eat or
drink in the astral plane, right?" The dwarf nods his head yes vigorously while continuing to hold out his hand
expectantly. "Okay then. We don't carry ale, but we do have some fine wine vintages." The orc pauses and closes her
eyes for a moment, "I have a feeling things are about to get complicated. Think I'll join ya." Reaching into a cabinet,
she retrieves two mis-matched glasses and an unlabeled bottle of red wine.

---

On the top deck, Grindlefoot positions himself behind a few crates where Illren, Zastra, and Lysan can't see him.
He arrives in time to hear Zastra finishing his sentence, "Oh, it's gone now."

Illren appears suspicious, "You seem jumpy, something on your mind?"

Zastra shuffles his feet and looks at his sister, Lysan, "Things don't seem right around here. How's Figaro? We
haven't seen him or spoken with him since we crashed."

"I'm doing all that I can to help Figaro!"

With the tension growing, Lysan questions her superior, "Are you?"

The hulking hippopotami moves in closer to Zastra and Lysan, his pleasant demeanor suddenly gone. "If you have
something to say, then say it." Several seconds of silence surround the three and the tension continues to grow.

"I have things to do," and Illren walks away, stomping harder than usual in his anger.

Knowing he needs to investigate the first mate's situation, Grindlefoot
[wild shapes into a tiny lizard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/635-druid-101-wild-shape-guide) and wriggles
off towards the mess deck and galley.

---

As Dolor reaches the door to the stateroom, he notices a tiny lizard skittering along the floor's edge. The tiefling
waits a moment and watches as it proceeds to go underneath the state room's door, but is stopped by some sort of barrier.
Several moments later, the lizard shifts into their three foot halfling companion. Grindlefoot hurriedly describes
the conversation between Illren, Zastra, and Lysan to the others.

"There's something blocking the door. I couldn't get past a force field when I tried to go underneath the door.
The first mate is in there. He's a tielfing and is sitting on the bed, having some sort of panic attack. He looks super
tense."

<!-- The following is AI Overview of "describe the Lambent Zenith from Vecna Eve of Ruin"
  The Lambent Zenith (Zambient) is a crashed spelljamming galleon in the Astral Plane, central to Chapter 3 of Vecna: Eve of Ruin, where adventurers explore its wreckage, fragmented and embedded in the body of a dead god (Havok) to find the Second Fragment of the Rod of Seven Parts. This once-grand ship, captained by Inda Malayuri and powered by the Rod, was destroyed by Vecna, its pieces scattered amidst the god's corpse, now home to monsters and perils. 
Key Aspects:
