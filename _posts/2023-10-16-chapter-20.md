Having defeated the animated pastries, Fred, the half-orc pastry chef at Dolly's Donuts, 
says in his slow, dry voice, "do or donut, there is no try."

More curious than before, Dolor and Mond continue to ask questions of Dolly and Fred. They
soon discover that the animated donuts were made with fresh flour delivered this morning
from Grinder's Mill. A quick check by Mond determines that it's enchanted. Dolor suggests
taking a sample of the magicked flour as evidence and Dolly gives them a full bag. 

On their way into the donut shop, Bilwin had noticed an interesting sign for Eclairvoyant's
Tea Shop placed on the front window. Dolly described Eclaire as a bit strange, but no moreso
than many of the other small shop owners in Food Alley. As the group is leaving Dolly's,
Bilwin and Grindlefoot ask Fred for some donuts to go, assuming they're made from non-magical
flour. In his drawling speech, Fred says, "well, they're not nearly as good as fresh ones and
I don't like folks to think of my creations that way, but okay, I suppose that's all we
have at the moment."

Entering Eclairvoyant's Tea Shop, they're greeted by Eclaire and a small area lovingly
curated with fine-looking éclairs, eccentric tea flavors, and eclectic furnishings with
an overwhelming smell of burning incense—that makes everyone cough just a little as they
pass through the front door.

"Welcome to Eclairvoyant's Tea Shop, where we guide you to your destiny while delighting
your tastebuds and olfactories!" Bilwin immediately responds with, "this doesn't look like
an old factory. Where are all the machines and dirty tables? Do they want me to work? I'll
work for beer, but it better be the good stuff."

When the introductions are complete, Eclaire agrees to answer their questions only if they
purchase private readings, for 1 gold piece each, mind you. Once their readings are complete,
she reveals that there have been some odd occurrences lately, magical things that she
cannot explain. For example, the door will unexpectedly begin talking to customers as they
enter the shop, telling them how bad the tea is or that the prophecies are lies.
Bilwin asks to see the flour they've used for their pastries and Mond
confirms that it's enchanted, like Dolly's Donuts. Eclaire confirms that they also use
Grinder's Mill, because they're local, have fair prices, and he's kind of nice,
especially for a dwarf.

The adventurers give their thanks and decide to head to Grinder's Mill next. On their way
out of the tea shop, Mond notices an odd marking on the door. A sigil that's sort of faded away—or
someone purposely tried to remove it—that is commonly used for the spell, 
[Magic Mouth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/magic-mouth). He notices another faded mark
scratched into the wood door that resembles two letter W's together, WW.

On their way to Grinder's Mill, Bilwin sees a sign for The Fizz Hutt and immediately becomes
entranced with kombucha. What is this fermented drink he's never heard of?

Entering The Fizz Hutt, they're greeted by a small gnome standing behind the counter,
although only his eyes and forehead are visible. "Welcome, friends! I be Thistlewick
Brandlestrum and this," he spreads his arms wide indicating the shop, "be the Fizz Hutt,
your favorite destination for all things kombucha!" Bilwin responds, "Hello, my
small-statured deliverer of new experiences! I've never heard of this thing,
come-booo-chah. Can you tell me about it?" A look of amazement crosses Thistlewick's face
as he jumps up on a stool so they can now see his upper body and takes on the pose of
a great orator.

> so divine that even ambrosia pales in comparison.

Bilwin and Dolor taste some of the uniquely named varieties of kombucha, enjoying them. Dolor
asks Thistlewick if he's experienced any odd magical-type things occurring in his shop and he
replies that he hasn't. After finishing the caffeine-filled kombucha, Bilwin is even more
frenetic than usual and Dolor has to guide him out of the shop, on towards Grinder's Mill.
