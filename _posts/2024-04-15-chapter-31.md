"You're an interesting sight. Curious what brought you here. Won't you come closer
so we can converse without yelling." It was more of a command than a request
from the female who must stand 25 feet tall. She had a pale blue complexion
and long dark hair that seemed to shimmer between brown, black, and even
the deep blue of a storm cloud. Dressed in leather armor that had obviously seen its
fair share of use in battle and casually holding a massive greatsword, with the point
resting on the ground, she was one to be careful around.

Cap'n Don pulls the Iron Vulture as close as he can to the giant rock she sits
atop of, although still a fair distance because of the shallow water surrounding
the two hundred foot tall outcrop. A small island sits close to the rock, where they
can see some trees and vegetation off a distance beyond the sandy beach.

"Welcome, travelers." She looks off into the distance for a moment and then back
to them. "This is a place I come to think...and listen to the stars speak. That is,
if they choose to. Their nature can be...fickle, to say the least. As I said,
you surprise me with your presence. Do tell." Again, it was more of a command than
a request.

Intrigued by the events, Grindlefoot returns to his halfling form. Unfortunately,
he's still up on the bow mast amidst all of the webbing and immediately becomes
entangled in his own butt-yarn. Struggling valiantly to free himself, the movement
only sealed the door on his prison. He became so intertwined with the knotted up
webbing, that his voice was muffled beyond recognition. "Mmmmfpppfh, bwwweeelllfff
ddeeee! Ooohhfff mmuuhh bwooootttthh issshh ffrriiied uppfh!"

They soon feel the rain becoming softer and the waves getting more gentle, when the
clouds part to reveal a calm sea surrounding a small island. Sitting on a very large
rock, two hundred feet high, is a large female figure, wearing polished scale mail
and holding a very large greatsword.

Nodding her head to the group, she says "you're a very bright thing in a very dark
place. That's unusual. I wasn't expecting that."

<!--
I THINK THIS GOES IN THE NEXT CHAPTER?

With an almost imperceptible wink
and smirk to Mond, the captain turns to the main mast and shouts up at Gven, currently on
watch in the crow's nest. "What do you see out off in the distance, barbarian?" 

With her gained experience and because she follows the
[Path of the Totem Warrior](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior), Gven has adopted
the Eagle's Aspect of the Beast that allows her to see 1 mile away as though it were only
100 feet. Not even having to squint, she sees heavy storm clouds blocking the light and pummeling
the sea with rains in the direction they're headed. It's unavoidable, unless they turn around
and head back to where they came from.
