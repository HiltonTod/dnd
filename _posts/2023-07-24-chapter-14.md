Walking westward, Bilwin and Blauer Mond have been traveling together for a few days, not
necessarily out of friendship. Rather, out of convenience, direction, and safety in numbers,
as so many travelers find themselves doing in these times of uncertainty. The two couldn't
be much more different, at least to the average passerby or observant. 

Bilwin, is a garishly dressed male [dwarf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/13-dwarf), carrying
a [hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy) across his back, and a mouth
that doesn't seem to ever stop talking. Meanwhile, Mond is a male [half-elf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/races/20-half-elf),
wearing non-descript traveling clothes and a light crossbow slung over his shoulder. Mond
seems to be ignoring Bilwin's constant prattling, until it stops and the sudden silence
reveals the sound of battle coming from the village up ahead. Apparently, Bilwin—self-titled
"the Magnificent," as he likes to remind everyone—is much more aware of his surroundings than
his constant chatter belies.

"Hold a minute, my hushed Half-Elven friend. Do you hear that? The sounds of battle are faint, but
coming from that village we near. Dare we continue our approach?" With a nod of his head
and a step forward, Mond gives his answer. "So we shall, my brave companion. So we shall! Tales
will be sung yet this night, indeed."

As the two travelers enter the edge of the village, they hear a large roar, followed shortly by
an undecipherable battle cry, and then silence. A few people begin emerging from a store on the
south side of the Ha-derech with a large sign identifying it as Bargain Ben's. They begin
whispering "is it over?", "are they gone now?", "is it safe?", and "do you think they're still
alive?" One of the villagers walks over to the local pub, apparently called the Buzzin Bee,
opens the front door and softly says "Hello? Anyone still alive in here who ain't a goblin?"
Bonnie pushes past the villager, through the Buzzin Bee's front door, and out into the street.
"The goblins have been turned away! Drinks are on me! Only one per customer though, so don't be
gettin yer hopes up to high, ya no-good'ers!" Trill pokes her head out behind her older sister,
"and I get to stay up late!"
