They watched the northern geyser erupt and spew the mucous-like fungus, disintegrating the rope that
Bilwin had taken across the chasm to make it easier to cross the hanging discs. After discussing a few
options, Grindlefoot suggests that he [Wild Shape](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/635-druid-101-wild-shape-guide)
into a [giant spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16895-giant-spider) and carry them across the
ceiling to the far ledge.

Everyone agrees to the halfling druid's plan, although Dolor has a special request. "Will you be sure to
wrap me up well enough that I can't fall. I don't have the best history with ropes and, yes, I realize
I'm a rogue."

Over the next half hour, Grindlefoot, as a spider, safely ferries the companions to the other side,
placing them safely on the opposite ledge. Unfortunately, [Golem](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16863-flesh-golem)
Number 9 proves to be heavier than Grindlefoot's butt-yarn can handle. A third of the way across the ceiling,
the webbing begins to stretch, the golem falling closer to the boiling mud below. As it reaches a few feet
from the bubbling surface, the webbing snaps and the golem falls into the mud. Its face remains oddly calm
as it slowly sinks into the scalding mire, looks at Gustaf one last time, and waves before its body is
consumed.

Gustaf slowly removes his fedora and brings it to his chest, covering his heart. "A kindred cartography
spirit in that one, no doubt. Regardless of their intellectual capacity, I honor their interest and
willingness to listen to an old man ramble on about the intricacies and history of map-making."

---

With Grindlefoot's assistance, Gustaf joins Mond, Dolor, Gven, Bilwin, and Grindlefoot on the opposite
ledge, investigating the wooden door. The tiefling goes first, "It's unlocked. Let's see if it was worth
being wrapped in butt-yarn and carried across a hundred-foot drop into boiling mud."

The door opens into a dark hallway, roughly 50 feet long, that ends at another closed door. Closing the
distance, Bilwin opens the door into a pitch-black room, even with his
[darkvision](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/br-2024/rules-glossary#Darkvision). A grinding noise
comes from inside, the sound of stone-on-stone moving slowly.

"Who dares awaken me?" The voice is deep and melodic, almost hypnotizing to their ears.

Bilwin pulls a coin from his pocket and it begins to [glow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619083-daylight)
as he tosses it into the room, rapidly spreading light as bright as day across the space. It's no
more than 30 feet to the south wall—opposite the door—and 30 feet across
from side to side. A stone sarcophagus rests against the far wall with the lid askew, space enough for a
small person to enter or exit the final resting place. Standing next to it, is a finely dressed dwarf with
pallid skin, piercing bright blue eyes, and elongated canines protruding from their mouth.

"I've never met a dwarven [vampire](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17043-vampire)! To be fair,
I've never met any vampire, but this still seems unique! Do you still like beer?" Bilwin moves into
the room slowly with Gven and Mond immediately behind him.

<!-- Initiative rolls:

-->

<!-- Round 1 -->

Understanding that the stakes have risen drastically, Gven pulls Tempest Edge from its sheath and invokes
her [barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/),
preparing for battle. The half-orc moves quickly, lunging with her magical greatsword, aiming for the
creature's chest and hoping for a killing blow.

The vampire moves faster though, taking her blade in its shoulder and showing no evidence of pain. Gven
within its reach, the dwarf grabs her arms with unexpected strength and pulls her close, forcing her
to bend at the waist as it puts its mouth to her neck. She feels the lifeforce drain from her as the
vampire's teeth pierce her skin and draw her blood.

The dwarven vampire releases Gven's neck, it stares deeply into her face and whispers words no one
else can hear. A second later, Gven returns Tempest Edge to its sheath and says aloud, "Why would I fight
such a magnificent creature." She stares at it with awe in her gaze as the wound she created only seconds
ago heals over.

Shocked at the sudden turn of events, Bilwin maintains his composure and hopes that the fortune of
Hanseath is shining on him while he casts [Turn Undead](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Cleric#toc_7).
The vampire looks to the dwarf, "Not this time, my kin."

Knowing that they face a likely undefeatable foe, Grindlefoot decides to avoid direct attack and instead,
investigate the sarcophagus. While the vampire is distracted, the halfling sneaks around its other
side and examines the stone coffin closely. He notices a small gap between it and the floor, a space
that might hold something or imply that they can move the coffin. Half to himself and half to the others,
"Hey, I think there's something underneath here. If only I can get a better look."

"Silence, child!" The vampire attempts to slap Grindlefoot to move him away from the sarcophagus, but
the halfling nimbly shifts in the other direction at that moment, inadvertantly avoiding its hand.

Mond momentarily focuses on the creature, uttering a spell underneath his breath.
"To feel pain and run away, shall be your plight, as you hear my
[Dissonant Whispers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619104-dissonant-whispers)."

The vampire visibly shutters in a small amount of pain, sighs heavily, and then turns into a misty
shape that flees the room.

In a rush, Dolor enters the room, drags Gustaf in behind him, and pulls the door shut. "Let's hope
it can't travel through wood."

<!-- Round 1 damage:
  Bilwin - 0
  Dolor - 0
  Grindlefoot - 0
  Gven - 4 piercing + 12 necrotic (max HP reduced by 12 until next long rest)
  Mond - 0
-->

<!-- Round 2 -->

The tiefling heard Grindlefoot's comment and sees the halfling still investigating the sarcophagus.
"We should try moving that thing, see if it reveals another way out of here. Or maybe something that
might help us."

"Gven, help me move the lid to the door. That might block it from returning," Bilwin shouts as he grabs
hold of the lid's end.

Enchanted by the vampire, Gven protests. "Why would we want it to stay away? It's so beautiful. And
we shouldn't mess with its stuff. That's private."

"I see something. Let me see if I can move things around a bit easier this way," and, once again, he
turns into a giant spider. With only a sliht struggle, the large arachnid pushes the sarcophagus to the
side and points at a large, ornately decorated war hammer lying in the space below where the coffin rested.

Mond moves closer to investigate the hidden area. Alongside the hammer, the half-elf sees some scrolls,
a few potion bottles, and coin pouches. He picks up one of the scrolls and deciphers its purpose, to
conjure minor elementals.

<!-- Round 3 -->

While Mond and Dolor inspect the cache of treasure, Gven loudly blurts out, "I hope he comes back. I
miss him already. Wasn't he great?"

A moment later, mist passes through the tiny holes in the woodend door and coalesces into the solid
form of the dwarven vampire. It looks at Mond, "Not funny. I fear no one or no thing."

A [bolt of light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt) surges from Bilwin's hand,
forcefully slamming into the vampire's chest. Appearing next to the dwarven cleric's head, a
[floating beer stein](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon) sends an invisible
blast of force at their opponent, causing it a small amount of pain.

The giant spider slings webbing at the vampire, attempting to restrain it against the door. The dwarf
steps to the side so quickly that Grindlefoot didn't see the movement.

Mond raises his hand and [shaft of lightning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618999-lightning-bolt)
streaks towards the vampire, slicing into its body and causing it to wince in pain. Retaliating, the
vampire closes the distance to the half-elf with unearthly speed and bites him. Mond feels his essence
being drained by the dwarf's elongated teeth.

Catching the dwarf off guard, Dolor swings Gleaming Blad with all his might, slicing through part of
its arm and causing it to loosen its grip on Mond. As quick as he could, the tiefling disengages and
moves away from the vampire.

<!-- Round 3 damage:
  Bilwin - 0
  Dolor - 0
  Grindlefoot - 0
  Gven - 0
  Mond - 6 piercing + 9 necrotic (max HP reduced by 9 until next long rest)
-->

<!-- Round 4 -->

The companions watch the vampire's wounds begin to heal. No matter how much they hurt it, the
creature withstands their attacks and deals more of his own to them. The vampire's face turns to
follow Dolor disengage, soon followed by an attack. With its uncanny strength, the dwarf grabs
the tiefling and pulls him closer, sinking its teeth into the rogue's neck. With a satisfying
exhale and smack of its lips, the vampire releases its bite. It takes a half-step backwards and
slaps Dolor across the face with a backhand, completely turning the tiefling to the side with its
force.

Another [bolt of light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt) erupts from Bilwin's
hand towards the vampire. It's body is shaken at the radiant damage, momentarily shaken. The
[floating beer stein](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon) shimmers slightly as
it sends a blast of force that misses the vampire.

Bilwin turns to his side, sees the ornate battle hammer in the cache and picks it up, ready to
continue the battle. The dwarf's head is immediately filled with a voice that can only be described
as dwarven. "Aye, get the dirty bastards! Slay those damnable giants and goblins! They deserve it,
more 'en ever now!" Bilwin shakes his head in confusion, wondering what sort of spirit possesses this
mighty warhammer.

Grindlefoot, still in the form of a giant spider, jumps at the vampire and bites it with his
pincers, piercing its skin and releasing its poison into the undead.

Attempting a spell for the first time, Mond [lashes out psychically](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:tashas-mind-whip)
at the undead dwarf. This attack visibly stuns their opponent, causing them to pause for a second.

Dolor follows up the sorcerer's attack, lunging forward with Gleaming Blade, skewering the dwarf
through its side. Even as he withdraws his blade from the vampire's flesh, the wound begins
to heal.

<!-- Round 4 damage:
  Bilwin - 0
  Dolor - 6 piercing + 12 necrotic (max HP reduced by 12 until next long rest)
  Grindlefoot - 0
  Gven - 0
  Mond - 0
-->

<!-- Round 5 -->

The vampire notices that Bilwin holds Whelm, the magical warhammer, and that this group is not
going to give up. He sighs heavily. "Take it and go. This prison shall hold me no longer," and
he dissolves into a mist that speedily moves out of the room.

"No, don't go! We're your friends! I don't know why the others attacked you so violently. You're
beautifully bewitching and enchanting. I want to go with you. Don't leave." Gven remains enchanted
by the vampire, unaware of the dire situation they narrowly escaped.

Mond's voice resonates through the room, as though magically amplified.

> ‘Cross cavern vast, where the chain-links rattle<br>
> Lies Whelm, past water-spouts double.<br>

Bilwin inspects the hammer closely, deciding that he prefers it to bludgeoning enemies with his encased
[hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy). "Aye, lad! Where them giants be hidin'? None
are safe wit us 'round to kill 'em!" The dwarf grimaces at the voice in his head, hoping it subsides.

They return to the ledge on the southern end of the large cavern, where they decide to take a short
rest and recover from their battle with the vampire.

While the group rests, Gustaf sits down and begins updating the map. The sad look on his face belies
missing his silent, grisly-looking, humanoid friend.
