Midnight has come and gone while the adventurers and Low Elves have defended the
village of Wayside from the first wave of the goblin horde. The Low Elves have been
protecting Scribbles & Nibs and Preva's Flowers, but the adventurers have been
focused on their own battles to save the Buzzin Bee...and the town and townsfolk.

They have little time to catch their breath before Dolor notices that a
[giant spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16895-giant-spider) is frantically
waving several of its legs from the top of a tree. "Ready yourselves, here we
go again!"

Fight choreography:

**Round 7**
*   15 goblins come out from the treeline and reveal themselves, 250 feet from the Buzzin Bee.
    *   5 of the goblins stop to fire their short bows at the heroes, all arrows missing their marks.
    *   10 of the goblins pass through the treeline and dash ahead 60 feet.
*   Dolor takes a long shot with his shortbow at one of the stationary goblins at the treeline,
    hitting his mark and killing it. "Huzzah!" he exclaims up to Cindel in the second story window.
*   Grindlefoot, as a giant spider, deftly climbs down his tree and bites one of the 4
    remaining goblins, killing it. Fortunately, he remembers to not drain the creature's blood
    before his spidery instincts take over.
*   Cindel fires her longbow at the closest goblins and misses.
*   Gven readies her two hand axes for short range throws, having thrown all 4 of her javelins.

**Round 8**
*   3 goblins at the treeline move ahead 30 feet and fire their shortbows, all missing.
*   10 closer goblins move ahead 30 feet and fire their shortbows, all missing.
*   Dolor fires another shot at one of the closer goblins, hitting it for 5 damage—it's now hobbling severely.
*   Grindlefoot shoots his web at one of the goblins close to him, missing wide.
*   Cindel fires two arrows in quick succession from her longbow, killing 2 of the closer goblins.
*   Gven holds, ready with her hand axes.

**Round 9**
*   3 goblins closest to the treeline move ahead another 30 feet and fire their shortbows, all missing.
*   8 closer goblins move ahead 30 feet and fire their shortbows at the defenders.
    *   Unfortunately, 3 arrows hit Dolor for 5, 3, and 4 piercing damage.
    *   The rest of the arrows miss, kathunking into the ground around Gven and the window frame protecting Cindel.
*   Dolor swigs a greater healing potion for 15 points of health.
*   Grindlefoot is too far from the closest goblins to attack and scrambles back up a tree to hold
    his position, keeping eight eyes out for more enemies coming from the forest to the North.
*   Cindel fires two more arrows at the goblins, killing one and missing another.
*   Gven continues to hold her ready position.

**Round 10**
*   _3 goblins alive at the 190' mark, and 7 goblins alive at the 130' mark._
*   3 goblins further away move ahead 30 feet, fire their shortbows and miss—shocking, I know.
*   7 goblins closer to Wayside move ahead 30 feet and fire their shortbows.
    *   Unfortunately, this time, two arrows connect with Cindel, causing 8 and 5 piercing damage.
    *   Dolor also gets hit by an arrow, receiving 7 piercing damage.
    *   The rest of the arrows miss.
*   Dolor fires his shortbow at the closest goblins and hits one, stopping it dead in its tracks—pun intended.
*   Gven yels up to Cindel, "need a healing potion up there?"
    *   "Yes," she groans loudly, "but I don't think throwing it from there will be any help and
        you're needed down there. Keep fighting."

**Round 11**
*   3 goblins farthest away move ahead 30 feet, fire their shortbows and—wait for it—miss.
*   6 closer goblins move ahead 30 feet and fire their shortbows, most of them missing.
    *   One arrow hits Dolor, causing 8 piercing damage.
    *   Gven takes one arrow for 2 damage.
*   Dolor misses with his shortbow then swigs a healing potion, receiving 11 healing points.
*   Grindlefoot senses something coming from within the trees to the North, but cannot tell if it's
    more goblins or something else.
*   Cindel, once again proving her prowess with her longbow, quickly kills 2 more goblins.
*   Gven's [barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/)
    has run its course, so she invokes it again while holding her position close to the Buzzin Bee.

**Round 12**
*   3 goblins farthest away move ahead 30 feet, fire their shortbows and miss—there really must be no other option.
*   4 other goblins dash ahead, now within 10 feet of Gven and Dolor.
*   Dolor closes to melee range and misses with Gleaming Blade, but then follows up with
    a swipe of his dagger, killing one of the goblins.
*   Grindlefoot can now sense—and hear—something very large moving through the trees towards him.
    He scuttles through the tree branches, moving laterally into other trees that seem out of
    the path of whatever is headed towards the battlefield. Once again, he waves several of his
    legs, trying to notify Gven or Dolor of the impending enemy.
*   Cindel, now hurting quite badly, can't quite find her usual strength and misses with her two arrows.
*   Gven, now that 3 goblins are finally within range, obliterates one of them with her greatsword.

**Round 13**
*   Two of the trees at the treeline break apart violently and an extremely large hill giant
    crashes through, roaring at the top of his lungs. The Great Mouth has made an appearance
    and the remaining goblins are obviously frightened, yet continue to attack.
*   3 goblins farthest away move ahead 30 feet, fire their shortbows and one actually hits
    Dolor, causing 4 piercing damage.
*   2 goblins close to Dolor and Gven attack them with rusty shortswords, but they're suddenly
    out of sorts and miss wildly.
*   Dolor swings Gleaming Blade with precision, killing it instantly, and then follows through
    with a swipe of his dagger, wounding the other goblin for 5 damage—it's barely hanging on to life.
*   Grindlefoot, still as a giant spider, shoots web at the hill giant, but misses.
*   Cindel sees the gargantuan hill giant for the first time and recognizes what will happen
    if the heroes fail to stop it. "That thing will level the whole town, we have to stop it here!"
    Summoning her last reserve of strength, she fires off two arrows from her longbow and one
    connects with the hill giant's shoulder, causing 14 damage.
*   Gven kills the injured goblin in front of Dolor, with an inattentive swipe of her greatsword
    and then moves forward to meet the other 3 goblins in melee combat.
*   Hill giant makes a frenzied dash forward, closing the distance quickly, moving from the treeline
    to the 170' mark.

**Round 14**
*   The 3 remaining goblins move forward to meet Gven in an attack and only one connects with
    its shortsword, causing 2 slashing damage.
*   Dolor moves forward to join Gven and kills one of the goblins with his shortsword,
    but missing another with his dagger.   
*   Grindlefoot knows that this is the final battle and dashes towards the hill giant, although
    he's still out of reach for his web attack.
*   Cindel is still in the throes of her surge in strength and fires off two arrows at the hill
    giant, both hitting it in its mid-section and causing 17 piercing damage.
*   Gven quickly dispatches one of the two remaining goblins.
*   Hill giant makes another frenzied dash forward, moving to the 90' mark and the emits
    another savage roar of [fear](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fear) that
    [frightens](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened)
    Gven, Grindlefoot, and Cindel.

**Round 15**
*   The last remaining goblin mistakenly thinks that Gven's frightened of it and with renewed confidence swings,
    she offhandedly bats away his shortsword.
*   Dolor isn't frightened by the hill giant's roar and fires an arrow from his shortbow, causing 7 piercing damage.
*   Grindlefoot is able to shake off the crippling fear of the hill giant, but unable to do anything else.
*   Cindel, still frightened of the hill giant, kills the last goblin with an arrow and then misses the giant.
*   Gven is able to shake off the crushing fear, but can't do anything else.
*   Hill giant closes the distance to Gven and Dolor, swinging its humongous club at them both. Dolor
    ducks in time to escape being hit, but the giant connects with Gven on their backswing for 6 damage.

**Round 16**
*   Dolor, still not frightened by the huge hill giant, swings Gleaming Blade at it and hits,
    for 15 damage, then follows up with a slash of his dagger, causing another 5 damage.
*   Grindlefoot, still in giant spider form, moves closer to the melee combat, wanting to help.
*   Hill giant roars loudly again, [frightening](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Frightened)
    Gven, Dolor, and Grindlefoot (Cindel is still frightened).
*   Cindel fires off 2 arrows, powering through the fear encompassing her whole body, and hits
    the hill giant with one, causing 10 damage.
*   Gven throws one of her hand axes at the giant, hitting it square in the chest, for 11 damage.
    She is then able to shake off the fear.
*   Hill giant swings it's monstrous club at Dolor and Gven, missing both by a slim margin, and then
    moves in closer to them for easier access.

**Round 17**
