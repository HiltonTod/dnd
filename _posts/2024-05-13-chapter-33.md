The adventurers suddenly find themselves flying above the ocean, gliding upward towards
the first layer of clouds. Looking down from the railings, they can see a large island
beneath them and several others off in the distance and in various directions. The group
begins to shiver from the wind gusts and cold air at this height. Grindlefoot hustles
below deck and soon returns bundled up in his fancy new coat. "Not only does it keep me dry,
but nice and toasty warm, too!"

Cap'n Don turns to Gven, "Whit dae ye see aff in the distance doon ablow, barbarian?"

Because she follows the [Path of the Totem Warrior](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior),
Gven has adopted the Eagle's [Aspect of the Beast](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior#toc2)
that allows her to see 1 mile away as though it were only 100 feet. She grabs ahold
of the railing with a tight grip and looks over.

"The one below looks to be the largest, at least of the islands I can see from here.
On the west side, there are two tall mountains, one taller than the other with what looks to
be an empty crater at the top. Flowing down one of its sides is a stream of black and dark
gray rock that appears to have sharp edges and...yep, I think a porous makeup. The rest of
the mountain is covered in thick vegetation and trees. So is the land surrounding the mountains
and most of the island. On the east side, there's a small township
or village with a handful of docks along its waterfront. There are some smaller boats
tied up and a few larger vessels off in a bay that must have deeper waters. I can't tell
much about the other islands, they're too far away for a clear look."

Bilwin pulls out his ancient map and excitedly says, "this one must be Amonah! Oy, this
old map needs to be updated. When will we get an opportunity like this again? Move us closer
so I can see better! Wait a minute...Gven, tell me what you see, and give me details!"

Mond looks behind them, back at the sea they were recently sailing on, to discover the waters
below churning in an unnatural manner. Beyond the turbulent area, the water is calm,
idyllic even, as though it's a magical protective barrier around the group of islands.

Dolor's curiosity drives his question to the captain, "how in the world are we doing this?"

Cap'n Don points at the runes and etchings carved into the vessel along every visible
surface. With a grin and quieter voice than usual, "She tinks tha she's aye in the watter."

He goes on to explain, "Thir runes, wi' a wee bit o' help frae me, mind ye, mak' the air
feel jist like the sea watter ablow us. Frae her perspective, she's still flootin' alang
the watter, bein' steered by the wind in her sails an' her rudder in the watter."
