The adventurers suddenly find themselves flying above the ocean, gliding upward towards
the first layer of clouds. Looking down from the railings, they can see a large island
beneath them and several others off in the distance and in various directions. The group
begins to shiver from the wind gusts and cold air at this height. Grindlefoot hustles
below deck and soon returns bundled up in his fancy new coat. "Not only does it keep me dry,
but nice and toasty warm, too!"

Cap'n Don turns to Gven, "Whit dae ye see aff in the distance doon ablow, barbarian?"

Because she follows the [Path of the Totem Warrior](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior),
Gven has adopted the Eagle's [Aspect of the Beast](https://dnd5e.wikidot.com/barbarian:totem-warrior#toc2)
that allows her to see 1 mile away as though it were only 100 feet. She grabs ahold
of the railing with a tight grip and looks over.

"The one below looks to be the largest, at least of the islands I can see from here.
On the west side, there are two tall mountains, one taller than the other with what looks to
be an empty crater at the top. Flowing down one of its sides is a stream of black and dark
gray rock that appears to have sharp edges and...yep, I think a porous makeup. They look like
dormant volcanoes, at least based on what I've heard of them. The land surrounding the volcanoes
and east of them is covered in thick vegetation and trees.
On the east coast, there's a small township or village with a handful of docks along its waterfront.
There are some smaller boats tied up and a few larger vessels off in a bay that must have
deeper waters. I can't tell much about the other islands, they're too far away for a clear look."

Bilwin pulls out his ancient map and excitedly says, "this one must be Amonah! Oy, this
old map needs to be updated. When will we get an opportunity like this again? Move us closer
so I can see better! Wait a minute...Gven, tell me what you see, and give me details!"

Mond looks behind them, back at the sea they were recently sailing on, to discover the waters
below churning in an unnatural manner. Beyond the turbulent area, the water is calm,
idyllic even, as though it's a magical protective barrier around the group of islands.

Dolor's curiosity drives his question to the captain, "how in the world are we doing this?"

Cap'n Don points at the runes and etchings carved into the vessel along every visible
surface. With a grin and quieter voice than usual, "She tinks that she's aye in the watter."

He goes on to explain, "Thir runes, wi' a wee bit o' help frae me, mind ye, mak' the air
feel jist like the sea watter ablow us. Frae her perspective, she's still flootin' alang,
bein' steered by the wind in her sails an' her rudder in the watter."

The group decides to do some reconnaisance from above. For the next few hours,
they fly around the edges of the island, keeping to the lower parts of the cloud cover to remain
concealed from below. They can see some people walking around the small port town, but
the rest of the island seems uninhabited. As Gven originally noted, the large dormant
volcano is on the west side of the island, abutting the shore with its volcanic cliffs.
On the east side of the jagged volcano, the plants, trees, and vines have done their best
to conquer the rocky terrain, covering it and hiding whatever might be living there.

Bilwin suddenly gets a serious look on his face, "I remember now. The dwarves call this group
of islands The Broken Heart, for a dwarven explorer felt a certain sadness when they came
across them." The dwarf shivers a bit, "although I cannot understand why he chose to
explore on the seas. Dwarves don't belong on water."

On the south side of the volcano, Gven catches sight of an old temple built directly on the
rock face. It's a good-sized stone building, with images of people and characters carved on
its walls that they don't recognize. Winding down the mountainside, a rocky path switches
back and forth until it reaches the jungle vegetation. Gven notices that the path exits
the jungle a short distance further and ends at a cliff looking out over the rough waters below.

The group notices what seems to be a small flock of birds rise from the trees at the base of
the volcano and fly directly toward them. Looking closely, Gven can tell that they have
human faces and naked female torsoes, with large wings on their backs. "Get ready, fellas.
Looks like some [harpies](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16919-harpy) want to welcome us."
