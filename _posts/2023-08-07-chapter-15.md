After vanquishing the [gnolls](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16904-gnoll) and investigating
the [hill giant's](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16923-hill-giant) lair—finding quite a bit
of loot, much to their surprise—the group heads back down the mountain to Lyra's Grove. When they
arrive, they can tell that Lyra was not expecting, or hoping for, visitors anytime soon.

"So, you're back...again...I see. I suppose that was to be expected. Since the Battle of Wayside,
the other goblin tribes seem to have gone quiet and their other hidey-holes haven't been used.
I imagine y'er hungry after a day's fightin' and rescuin' loot, I'm about to cook up an older deer
the forest saw fit to provide us for sustenance."

With a brief nod and acknowledgement of its value and purpose, Lyra begins cooking smaller pieces
of the deer over a small campfire while offering some flatbread and berries. Bilwin offers her a
beer from his seemingly bottomless carrying cask and she graciously accepts.

From his satchel, Dolor pulls out the box of delicate turquoise animal figurines. "We'd like you
to have these, if you're of interest, as a means of thank you for all of your assistance and
hospitality." Lyra takes the tiny box into her hand, slowly opens the lid, and quietly says, "we
rangers don't hold ta 'stuff' like them villagers do, but...these remind me of my purpose...why
I patrol these woods." With a look of calmness, Lyra pulls a small leather pouch out of a pocket
and carefully drops the figurines into it, handing the box back to Dolor. She draws a symbol in
the dirt, that looks like a letter U with a small tick going through the top right side.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#124;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#92;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#47;<br>

"I don't do gifts...but I do favors. If you ever find yerselves in a bit of a mess or tight spot or
just need the perspective of a ranger, make this mark somewhere around ya. If I can't get to ya,
then one of my brethren will know that yer a friend of a ranger and in some need." She quietly
pulls together her meal, mug of beer from Bilwin, and shimmies up one of the larger trees in the
glade. Apparently, she's had enough socializing for the day and has retired for the evening.

The adventurers continue to chat amongst themselves, other than Bilwin tossing a few one-liners
up into the tree, most of which Lyra ignores. They agree to continue on towards Elsemar in the
morning, westward on the Ha-derech. Lyra tells them that they'll have the company of the Lamayum
River for a while on their journey, until it turns southward.

Long rest....

When they wake in the morning, Lyra is nowhere to be seen, but she's left them a cold breakfast
of flatbread, honey, and more berries. The adventurers eat quickly, tidy up the grove, and
head towards the Ha-derech. Within a few hours, the reach the main thoroughfare and turn westward.
Traffic is fairly light, especially in the early part of the day. As the day progress into
afternoon and they leave the Quiet Valley, the terrain flattens out and opens up into flatlands.

Leading the group, Gven catches sight of a dust cloud up ahead and the sound of hooves, although
unlike any horse hooves she's ever heard. Moments later, she can just make out colorful banners
and the sounds of strange animals. Whatever it might be is moving slowly, for it takes a bit of
time before Gven can tell that a man on a large white horse is leading a traveling menagerie, with
some animals even she doesn't recognize.

"Well met, fellow travelers! I am Zarluu and this," he waves dramatically at the caravan behind him,
"is Zarluu's Magical Menagerie!" A voice pipes up from further back in the caravan, "why is it
always called Zarluu's, why not my name?" "Because it's my caravan and I'm on the big white horse
at the front, that's why!."

Turning back to Gven and the others, "apologies for my companion's ineptitude. Now, where was I?
Oh yes, Zarluu's Magical Menagerie!"

Bilwin slyly asks, "While I have no qualms with those who delve into the magical arts, my friend,
the last I heard, the Hand of the Wand frowns upon its use."

"Ah, magical, but NOT arcane, my dear associate!" At that point, Grindlefoot spies a creature
unlike anything he's seen before. Standing at six feet tall, the creature has skin like a snake,
stands on its two massively muscled hind legs, with a 4 foot tail providing it balance and power,
and two tiny two-foot long arms just below its shoulders. Its head is large and oblong in shape,
consisting mostly of its mouth with very large—and quite sharp—teeth inside. Grindlefoot runs over
to the creature's cage and it meets him with a resounding roar while attempting to bite the
cage's bars. A large man clad in reinforced leather—most likely to protect him from
the beast—knocks Grindlefoot away from the cage with a lengthy pole. "Mind yer paws, there Tiny!
Daisy'll take 'em off afore ye even know they're gone!

"Baluu! Easy! Be easy with these fine folks, who might also be customers," shouts Zarluu from his
mount. The adventurers look at each other and notice the sun's position in the sky, it's late
afternoon and they agree to set up camp a bit early for some possible entertainment.

Gven has an affinity for animals and dislikes seeing them in cages, especially when they're used
for entertainment purposes. Cruelty and mistreatment often goes hand-in-hand with these sort of folks.
"Before we agree to watch your show, might I inspect the animals?"

"But of course, my sizable lovely companion with the exceptionally large and sharp sword!"

Gven scans the caravan, looking for an animal with a decent amount of intelligence. She sights two
gorillas, lounging in a larger wagon with bars that seem loosely held together. Walking over to them
slowly, she quietly casts [Speak with Animals](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/speak-with-animals).
After several minutes of grunts, barks, and hoots, Gven is able to glean that the animals are
exceptionally well cared for by Zarluu and the caretakers. The two gorillas are quite happy, other
than two small requests: more bananas and hit fewer bumps in the road.

"You have my thanks and my patronage, Zarluu. I look forward to seeing your animal companions
perform. Oh, and the gorillas are requesting more bananas and a smoother cart ride."

"Ah, yes, bananas are particularly difficult to come by in this part of Olam. We find them where
and when we can, but we provide our furry friends with plenty of leaves, shoots, stems, and bark.
We also let them search for grubs and ants when we're far enough away from villages and towns, where
the folks might get a little...spooked by a 300 pound primate they're not used to seeing in their
local forests."
