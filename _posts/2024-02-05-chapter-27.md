The bolt smashes against the chalkboard, embedding itself amidst the scribbles and
notations from Professor Verin. Everyone turns to see two cloaked figures standing by
the doorway into the classroom and four others in leather armor, slowly spreading
outward from the door. One of them is stopped a few paces from the cloaked assailants
at the door, still aiming their crossbow at the group by the chalkboard.

Professor Verin drops to the floor as quickly as possible and hides behind the sturdy
table where the ancient map is laid out. Dolor can barely hear him mumbling, "That Tella,
this is the last time I do a favor for him. I don't care how 'interesting' the subject
matter. It's not worth losing my feathers or beak!"

* Mercenary 1 leaps at Dolor with their longsword, causing 11 slashing damage with their
  first swing and missing on their second.
  * Dolor reacts with [Uncanny Dodge](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/rogue#UncannyDodge-347),
    reducing the damage to 6.

  on their second for 9 damage.

  narrowly missing.
* Dolor attacks Merc 1 with Gleaming Blade, connecting twice for 16 damage.

  appears in the air next to Dolor and misses its swing at the tiefling.
* Robed-cleric 2 casts a similar bolt of dark energy at Gven and misses, then follows with another
  shining black sword that hangs alone in the air and swipes at her, causing 7 damage.
* Gven invokes her [barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/)
  and swings her greatsword at Merc 2 twice, connecting both times for 13 and 18 damage—they
  suddenly look quite vulnerable.
* Bilwin is visibly upset about almost being skewered by a crossbow bolt and attacks Merc 2
  with his [hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy), causing 8 damage and killing them.
* Mond casts [Mind Spike](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:mind-spike) at Merc 3 for 6 damage and
  follows that up with a [Shadow Blade](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:shadow-blade) attack that misses.

<!-- Round 2 -->
* Grindlefoot casts [Haste](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/haste) on Dolor, who can suddenly

  and misses, as does their magical sword.

  and misses, but their suspended magical sword connects for 4 damage.
* Gven attacks Merc 4 with her greatsword, connecting on both swings for 15 and 11 damage.
* Bilwin swings his hurdy-gurdy at Merc 4, missing on his first attempt then thumping them on his
  second for 6 damage.

    and it appears as a floating beer stein that attacks Merc 4, causing 10 damage and killing them.

* _Mercenaries 2 and 4 are dead, leaving two more mercs and the two robed clerics still alive and fighting._

* Robed-cleric 1 casts a black smoke-like energy field at Dolor, causing him to take 13 necrotic damage.
  * Dolor responds with [Hellish Rebuke](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hellish-rebuke), causing
    24 in damage to the cleric.
  * The suspended sword swings at Dolor and misses.
* Robed-cleric 2 casts a similar black smoke-like energy field at Gven, causing him to take 11 necrotic damage.
  * The suspended black sword swings at Gven and connects, causing 2 damage.
* Gven swigs a healing potion and regains 16 health then attacks Merc 3 with her greatsword for 16 damage,
  killing them instantly.
  * She quickly moves to Cleric 2 and connects with her greatsword, causing them 15 in damage—they're
    looking pretty haggard.
* Bilwin whacks Cleric 1 with his hurdy-gurdy, inflicting 12 damage.
  * The magical beer stein attacks Cleric 1 and causes another 8 damage.
* Mond casts [Chaos Bolt](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:chaos-bolt) at Cleric 2 for 13 in acid damage,
  then drinks a health potion to regain 9.
* _All four mercenaries are dead and one of the two robed clerics is looking battered._

<!-- Round 4 -->
* Grindlefoot casts [Healing Word](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/healing-word) at Mond, granting him
  10 health and then takes a health potion for himself, increasing his helth by 9.
* Dolor attacks Cleric 2, who isn't doing well, with Gleaming Blade for 19 damage, killing them.
  * Still moving at twice his normal speed, and before anyone realizes that the other cleric has been killed,
    Dolor expertly slices Cleric 1 twice with his sword, causing 11 in damage.

As the dying cleric's body falls to the floor, it suddenly erupts into flames with a bright flash and loud whoosh
of air, as though it was being sucked out of the room. The other cleric, the only attacker remaining from the
original six, notices its companion's fate and mutters a spell that the adventurers can't quite make out. Their
body suddenly bursts into flames, leaving two piles of ashes where each of the clerics once stood.

Each member of the group looks around slowly, wondering if more combatants might come running through
the door. Bilwin sees that Gven is still hurting from the short battle and casts
[Healing Word](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/healing-word), helping cure her wounds.

Professor Verin crawls tentatively out from under the sturdy desk, moving their head all the
way around, like an owl verifying that the coast is clear. "I'm done with Tella's favors! You
tell him that! No more! And now, I think it's a good time to head home for the day." He's flustered
by the audacity of the mercenaries to attack them in broad daylight, in the supposed safety
of the university, and to use clerical magic so openly.

Ever practical, Dolor searches the mercenaries' pockets, finding nothing of apparent value. Although,
each one carries a small coin with the image of the ship on it, the same as they saw in Davanor's
warehouse. The Damian seems to have noticed their interest and escapades, despite their lackadaisical
yet sincere efforts to disguise their activities.

Not wanting to leave a mess or add to any of Professor Verin's stress, Grindlefoot
[wild shapes](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/635-druid-101-wild-shape-guide) into a
[giant spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16895-giant-spider) and moves the dead bodies up to
the roof, wrapping each one up in a web cocoon. At least the suspicion will be on a giant spider roaming
Elsemar, rather than any ill-fated associations of poor Professor Verin.

The group decides that Tella needs to be appraised of the situation, regardless of the time of day
or their agreement to stay away from the Broken Spy Glass. It's likely that Davanor is already aware
of their association. When they arrive at the pub, Dolor goes in through the back door and gives
Tella an update. He agrees that they did the right thing in telling him sooner than later and will
follow up with Professor Verin. He urges them to return to the Iron Vulture for the night, get some
rest, and they'll regroup on the morrow.

The rain storm outside is howling and blowing as though the gods themselves are unleashing their
displeasure on the mere mortals who dare to think that they can move freely around Elsemar. Night's
darkness has set on the town as the five adventurers make their way to the ship they temporarily
call home. There aren't many others on the streets, enduring the rageful weather, only those who must
get to where they're going. Only Grindlefoot, in his newly acquired cloak and boots, is remotely
dry, even though the fiercely gusting wind still threatens to pick him up and hurry him along a
completely unintended route.

As they navigate the narrow cobblestone streets, their surroundings camoflauged by the darkness of
night, howling winds, and downpour of rain, they barely notice a lone figure standing off to the side
of the road. Concerned only with reaching safety from the elements, the group passes without a
second glance.

"Sister, you've found me."

Gven recognizes that voice. She quickly turns to the ghostly figure, moving closer before her
companions even realize that she's doing so. 

"Where the fuck have you been, Torp?"
