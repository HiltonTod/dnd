Still regaining their breath from the recent skirmish with the four goblins, the adventurers
investigate the chamber before proceeding further inward. It's roughly forty feet by forty feet
and seems to be of natural origin, better at preventing wayward animals than armed foes from
entering the goblin's caves. While investigating the chamber, Grindlefoot ponders out loud,
"why do frogs have [darkvision](https://roleplayersrespite.com/darkvision-5e)?" Only silence
answers.

The group looks to the opposite end of the cavern from where they entered and see that the tunnel
continues onward. Xantic sends McGillicutty to explore ahead of them, looking out for danger
of any sort. The tunnels appear to become more natural, smaller in width and height, and less
like they were shaped by tools. At some exceptionally short points, Gven and Dolor are forced to
crawl in order to continue forward. Eventually, the tunnel opens up enough for the group to
stand up and stretch their limbs, although they must continue walking single file.

Gven is following behind McGillicutty and notices the floor has a peculiar feeling to it, even
though McGillicutty hasn't reported anything amiss. Suddenly, she falls into a pit that had a
thin covering over it, obscuring it from view. Feeling more embarrassed than hurt, Gven takes
2 damage from the ten foot drop and then crawls up the far side, ten feet away from where she
fell.

The remaining group members snicker at her failure to detect or navigate the naturally formed
pit. As though Joli (jaa·lee), the God of Pooping Crows, is looking down upon them at that
very moment, each of the others also fall into the pit—even while knowing it's there—with
Xantic taking 4 damage, Grindlefoot 3, and Dolor 3. McGillicutty shrugs their tiny shoulders
and half-grins at the others inability to navigate the pit as easily as McGillicutty had.

Continuing onward, the group encounters another cavern that opens up from the tunnel. Dolor
sneaks up to the opening and can see two [bugbears](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16817-bugbear)
on the far side of the cave. The adventurers ready their weapons and begin sneaking towards
the bugbears, hoping that they're sleeping or unaware. They cover 30 feet, about halfway across
the cave, when Xantic and Dolor trip over the tiniest of cracks in the floor, alerting
the bugbears to their presence. One of them sounds the alarm, clearly alerting anyone or thing
in the system of tunnels.

Dolor shrugs his shoulders and says "Oh well, here we go."

Fight choreography:
*   Xantic shoots a goblin with his crossbow, causing 9 damage.
    *   McGillicutty casts [Frostbite](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/frostbite) at a goblin
        and misses.
*   Dolor misses with his shortbow.
*   Grindlefoot shifts out of the rat form and unexpectedly finds himself completely blind to
    their surroundings as a halfling. He starts to slowly move backwards, towards the presumed
    safety of the empty tunnel they just left.
*   A goblin fires an arrow at Gven for 7 damage.
*   A goblin hits Dolor with an arrow for 7 damage.
*   Dolor reacts with [Hellish Rebuke](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hellish-rebuke), causing
    6 damage and briefly lighting up the room.
*   A goblin fires an arrow and misses Grindlefoot, who somehow knew to step sideways at that
    very moment.
*   A goblin pierces Xantic with an arrow for 6 damage.
*   Gven swings her greatsword at the goblin closest to her, who Dolor lit up with his Hellish
    Rebuke spell, killing it instantly.
*   Xantic shoots a goblin with his crossbow again, causing 3 damage.
    *   McGillicutty casts Frostbite again, instantly freezing and killing the unbalanced goblin,
        leaving it to slowly fall over onto its side.
*   Dolor misses the final goblin with his shortbow.
*   The last living goblin turns to flee the large room, heading deeper into the tunnels.
*   As swiftly as she's able, Gven pulls a handaxe from her belt and hurls it at the
    retreating goblin. Twirling through the air unexpectedly fast, the axe lands in the middle
    of the creature's back, embedded all the way to the cheek of the blade. In midstep of
    fleeing, the goblin stops suddenly and gently topples over to the ground, dead.

The group pauses for several moments to collect their breath, grateful that they made it this
far without any alarms being sounded. Xantic creates a glowing rock for Grindlefoot to carry
and use as a lantern. 

Looting the goblin corpses, they don't find much of value except for 10 silver pieces, 30 copper
pieces, and a rusty old sword. Given Dolor's experience with jewelry and watches, he takes an
extra close look at the sword to discover it's more than it appears. What they initially thought
was rust is only dirt and grime from the lack of cleaning. It's extremely well made and still
exceptionally sharp, even shiny in the spots that Dolor wipes away. He replaces his rapier with
the shortsword, wondering if he might discover any other secrets about it in the future.
