As the afternoon wears on and the sun begins to set, Dolor continues to follow the ancient
roadway, although plant growth and time has obscured most of it from view. Realizing that
they'll need to set up camp soon, he notices a large tree that has fallen over and might
provide some shelter, or at least a semblance of cover. Upon investigating the decaying
tree, they discover that it's hollowed out and has barely enough room for them to gather
and rest while concealed. 

Scouting around their tree, Grindlefoot discovers a small tiered waterfall that comes
from a spring close by. To the halflings surprise and delight, there are sweet potatoes
and bananas growing near the waterfall. "Ah-ha, we have dinner!"

The night proceeds without any interruptions, allowing the adventurers to rest well
for the next day.

Long rest....

Having the last watch of the night, Grindlefoot decides to make banana and sweet potato
pancakes for the breakfast. The others wake to the aromatic smells of hot pancakes over
a small fire.

After breakfast, the group realizes that by following the old road they wandered slightly
West from their intended path to the mountain temple.

Mond says, "Since we accidentally moved closer to the
[earthmote](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Earthmote),
is anyone else interested in seeing it close up? This seems like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
I've read about them, but they're exceptionally rare and I never expected to encounter one."

"That will likely take us most of the day," Dolor responds. "We've come farther West than
I thought, but that hanging rock is still probably another 2-3 hours walk through this
jungle, further away from the temple. If we fix our direction and start towards the temple
now, we'll have only lost a few hours."

After some discussion, they agree that a floating boulder is worth looking at closer and head off
towards the oddity. After a few hours of hacking through the jungle vegetation to break a trail,
the group approaches the edge of the gorge and is able to finally get a close look at the earthmote.

The stone is shaped like a heart and hangs roughly forty feet above them and sixty feet from
the edge of the cliff, over the gorge. The canyon is more shallow here, with the earthmote
hovering about sixty feet above the ground. The heartshaped boulder is about thirty feet
around and the same distance from top to bottom. The tree atop it appears to be petrified,
which makes sense given its living conditions, and its roots jut out from all angles on the
underside of the earthmote.

It continually rotates slowly to the left and after a minute, they see an opening in the side
of the rock that appears to be the size of a normal door, with a narrow set of stairs coming
out of the doorway and up to the top of the rock.

Bilwin unbundles his [hurdy-gurdy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurdy-gurdy) and begins to
tune it, "we need to get someone's attention. Let's see if they enjoy music."

Dolor whispers under his breath, "might want to let someone else try playing that thing."

To the group's surprise, Bilwin begins to play with a skill and passion rarely seen. The
instrument's unique timbre, a blend of the ethereal and earthy, creates a nostalgic atmosphere.
A melody unfolds in dwarven—which only Gven understands—that weaves a tapestry of strangers
meeting, exchanging cross words, a misunderstanding, fighting to defend their honor,
reaching a draw between equally competent combatants, and reconciliation over the smooth
flavors of a beer brewed by [Hanseath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hanseath).

When Bilwin looks up from his instrument and his friends awaken from their surprise,
they see a tall robed figure standing on top of the earthmote, next to the tree and looking
across the way at them. Pushing their cowl back, an elven woman with blond hair quietly says,
"while beautifully performed, there's a reason why my kind did not invent that instrument.
Having said that, I appreciate your efforts and invite you to join me." With the flick of her
hand, an arrow with a rope attached shoots out from the floating rock and embeds itself in
the ground at the party's feet, causing the rock to stop rotating.

The adventurers scurry across the rope, with Mond displaying his half-elven heritage as he
nonchalantly walks along the top. Dolor, the notoriously agile rogue, experiences a bit of
vertigo but eventually makes it to the rock.

"I am Valindra, a student of life and the mystical properties of this island. Please, sit
and tell me why you have interrupted my studies." With another motion of her hand, the
arrow and attached rope retract from the cliff's edge, seemingly melding into the rock itself,
and it resumes turning slowly in a clockwise direction.

Gven provides a summary of their travels so far and why their search led them here, to this
island in the middle of the Cracked Crystal Sea. When describing their battle on the ancient
bridge, a few miles east of the earthmote, Valindra looks down and slowly shakes her head.
"That bridge and its protector have been here centuries, longer even than I have lived here."

Dolor asks, "can you tell us more about the temple on the mountain, the island, or the people
in the port town on the eastern coast?"

"I came to this island long ago, shortly after [The Conflict]([[ch. 26](/dnd/campaign/chapter-26/)])
ended, to study the gods. I wandered the island for decades, observing the people, the creatures,
and the gods themselves before finding this earthmote and making it my home. If this island is
the birthplace of the gods, and their refuge, then the volcano where your destination can
be found is the center of their...essence. Stories say it's a place to make a god feel at
home, a sanctuary for it to reveal its presence in full. It's not just a representation of a
god's home, but the source of a god's power...their soul."

"Deep within the temple there is a red gate that guards the origin of the gods. Or so I've been
told, because I'm unable to venture inside. I only know what I've learned through my many
inquiries of and discussions with those courageous—or stupid—enough to make the journey. In
the last several years, I've seen much more activity around the temple. There are frequent
pilgrimages from the port town, including strangers arriving from other lands."

Taking in the elven wizard's words, Gven asks, "is there anything you can share to help us?"

With an intent look, even moreso than before, Valindra says, "be mindful of the gods
personalities, whims, and quirks. They created that bridge and its puzzle and its not
the only barrier you'll encounter on your journey. You'll need your wits, all of them,
and to not trust your senses overly much." As she ends her comment, another slight
wave of her hand causes the rope and arrow to shoot out from the boulder and connect
to the cliff's edge.

The group thanks Valindra for her time and information and then takes their leave. As Dolor
is crossing the rope, he loses his grip and begins to fall into the jungle below in the gorge.
Bilwin is prepared and casts [Feather Fall](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2095-feather-fall),
allowing Dolor to contemplate his slow descent as the others successfully navigate the rope
to the cliff's edge.

When the remaining adventurers reach the cliff, the arrow suddenly retracts into the
earthmote and there's no sign of Valindra. Bilwin looks down into the gorge, where Dolor
is no longer in sight, and yells "How ya doing down there?" The only response is silence.
