Dolor and Mond stand closest to the door as it continues to slide to the left, slowly
and quietly revealing a room about the same size as the one they first entered. Bilwin
walks up behind them, holding his magic stein higher and it illuminates the area with the
[Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618996-light) spell he cast on it earlier.

The room is circular, with the same hieroglyphics carved into the stone walls as in
the previous chamber and stairway. A tiny stream trickles across it, from one side to the
other, contained in a shallow pathway depressed into the floor. In the middle of the room,
the stream splits in two directions, forming a circle around a statue before rejoining
on the other side and continuing onward, beneath a low cut hole in the wall that allows
it to continue its journey. 

The statue looks like a gorilla, sitting in a meditative pose with four arms stretched
outward and hands facing upward. Its face is calm, as though it embraces its fate, to be

"I'm Gustaf Mondalbrot, an archaeologist of the...what in the world is that!" Seeing a
giant spider hovering behind Gven and Nyx, the odd little man quickly hides behind the statue.

It takes the group more than a few minutes to convince Gustaf that they won't hurt him
or feed him to the giant spider. Finally, the spider realizes what's going on and leaves
the doorway. A moment later, a halfling enters the room, brushing past Gven and Nyx.
"What did I miss? Oh, nice to meet you, sir. I'm Grindlefoot, a farmer and connesiur of nuts,
mostly the roasted kind. What are you doing stuck in this room?"
