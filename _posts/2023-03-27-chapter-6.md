During breakfast, the companions are able to get a closer look at Skeller. He's tall, at around
6'1", and dressed simply in comfortable travelling clothes. During the discussion, they learn
that he's been travelling westward, from Mirgansor in the East, and hasn't encountered anything
odd. At least any more odd than he usually does. The townsfolk of Wayside, especially an elf named
Cindel, were eager to tell him the tale of the Chimera.

Skeller paused for a moment and sat thoughtfully, then said "I did buy some lovely flowers from
an amiable woman namded Prema. While I was in the Buzzin Bee, the townsfolk described the horrible
circumnstances of her husband and child being lost in the woods. Yet, when I spoke with her, there
seemed to be more to her tale than the folk realized...or maybe let on. I got the impression they
were a bit embarrassed for not being able to do more to help poor Prema."

"According to Prema, her husband was the most loyal, dedicated husband and father she knew of in
their small village. She knew he wouldn't abandon her or their daughter without something serious
having happened. He might not have been the best farmer, bless his heart, but he was a good hunter
and knew how to traverse the wilds. He never would have gotten lost, especially in these lands
that he knew so well. She's of the mind that they ventured across the river and the goblins got 'em."

The companions looked at each other in turn, realizing that they might not be quite ready to leave
the Wayside area.

Then Dolor turned the subject to another area of interest, especially to Gven. "Skeller, have you
any knews of Elsemar? We're headed that way, looking for a friend of ours." He then looks over
to Gven, prompting her to share as much information as she's ready. She goes on to describe how her
brother, Torp, left for his _Coming Out_ eight years ago and hasn't been heard from since, which
is extremely unusual. They ran into a rider from the Pride and Comfort in Wayside, who happened
to see a half-orc that looked eerily similar to Gven in Elsemar.

After describing the building that the Pride and Comfort rider told her about, Skeller
paused and rubbed his chin, in that way they'd quickly come to see him display when he's
contemplating his next words carefully. "I know of that building. They don't really care for
my type, or many other types, if you know what I'm meaning. It's a law firm run by a muckety-muck
who goes by the name of Davinor. He does a lot of work on the, how should I put it, seedier
side of the law. If your brother was in there and givin off the unhappy vibe that P&C rider told
ya, then my guess is that he weren't there for any reason to his own benefit."

The adventurers express their gratitude to Skeller, especially Gven, and decide to move on
quickly towards Elsemar. The city is still 5-6 long days of walking away. But they all need
breakfast and Xantic is excitedly cooking up his special "garbage omelet." It actually tastes
quite good, although no one asks about the specific ingredients.

Skeller tells them that he'll remain in that spot for a bit of time. That's the way of their
people, the tinkerers. There's always a reason to stop and, eventually, a reason to get going
again. He'll stay here for a bit longer to see who else might need his wares or services. Word
travels quickly when a tinkerer is around and he trusts it to guide him, as do all tinkerers.
Setting up camp around his wagon, he establishes a perimiter of warning sticks with tiny bells
on theme and attached by string. Dolor elicits a smile in fond memory of doing this with his
own family when he was younger.

The adventurers say their farewells to Skeller and head eastward, towards Elsemar and whatever
situation they might find Gven's brother inhabiting. As they walk, Grindlefoot and Gven ask
Dolor about the 'big city' of Elsemar. They've both only experienced small villages, farming
communities, and tribes roving across the grasslands.

As Dolor describes Elsemar to the group, he tells them about his past. His parents are
tinkerers of great renown for their jewelry and watchmaking, often fulfilling customized
orders for wealthy people in Elsemar, some of whom have more money than sense. As pacifists,
like most tinkerers, his parents would sometimes find themselves the victims of theft. Not
in the normal sense of being robbed at sword-point, rather customers refusing to make payment
for the very services they had requested.

While his parents were of the mind to let bygones be bygones and move on with life, Dolor
had different ideas. He would usually find stealthy ways into their homes and take the
requisite payment in whatever way was the most accessible. Of course, he never took more
than they were owed, hence his services weren't considered illegal. Besides, these sorts
of customers were hesitant to report anything to the authorities, as they usually had other,
bigger concerns if the authorities were involved. Fortunately, Dolor excelled at this and
none of the customers were able to track his actions back to his parents. Justice wears many
faces.
