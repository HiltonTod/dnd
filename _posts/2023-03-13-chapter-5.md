The group of adventurers spends a week in Wayside, resting and relaxing, gaining new friends,
listening to tales in the Buzzin Bee's common room, and learning that Preet, from the Low Elves,
is much better at telling stories than he is at playing the lute—and his song lyrics and poetry
are still horrid. It's been an enjoyable time getting to know the townsfolk and building
relationships they'll miss while on the road.

One evening in particular, Preet is entertaining a packed crowd with various tales when
someone yells out "tell us about the Uprising!" With a lengthy sigh and conspiratorial look at
the crowd, he quietly says "if that's what you'd like, but know that it's not always a welcome
subject, so be careful where and *when* ye ask for 'em." His eyes are directed at a member of
the Pride and Comfort seated in the back of the room, who is quietly scanning the crowd until
his gaze rests on Gven.

### _The Uprising..._

Several centuries ago, magic was common in Eritz and the rest of Olam, and magic-users were
well respected by the citizens, revered even. They made phenomenal discoveries and advances in
the mystic arts that improved the lives of all in Eritz. One wizard, Acertep, led them with
a noble mind and sincere heart, expanding their power and influence across the continent. As
it tends to do, greater power lead to greater arrogance and the magic users began to see
themselves as above the law. Who was anyone to question their benevolence or magnanimous
intentions?

Acertep continued to lead the magic users in Eritz as they mutated into an unbending and
unrelenting force for authoritarian control over all others. Along for the ride, the religious
leaders allied themselves with the magic users. The clerics and paladins of the clergy would
police the populace and fight in battles alongside the magicians and wizards. The magic users
and clergy felt that they, and only them, knew what was best for the world, no one else could
contribute or lead in their stead.

For all of their power, the magic users and clergy were few in numbers when compared with
the rest of the population. Either of those paths took decades of disciplined study, earnest
practice, and focused apprenticeship. Those were often the paths of the privileged and
elite members of society, inaccessible to the average farmer, shopkeeper, or mercenary.

Finally. the tyranny became too much to endure for the non-magic and secular people. The
regular folks had numbers on their side, easily outnumbering their authoritarian leaders by
thousands to one. They also had the grit and determination that comes with knowing that
losing isn't an option, for they had nothing left to lose. The magic-users and clergy were
overthrown by the Eritzians over a couple of years, through bloody battle after bloody battle.

The new leaders created two groups to protect them from the sort of magical and religious
tyranny they had endured for so long: the Hands of the Wand and the Eyes of the Star.

The **Hands of the Wand** keep track of the magic users in the land and the **Eyes of the Star**
monitor religious and faith-based groups. They travel in pairs, working together to maintain
the safety of the people. Their uniform consists of durable leather armor with deep purple cloaks
that have large hoods—keeping their faces in the shadows—and conceal their weapons. It's
well known that the Hands of the Wand are magic users themselves, of course regulated and
monitored by their brethren. While both groups are well respected, even revered by many, some look
upon them with cynicism or concern that they're just different authoritarian masters.

Since the Uprising, both magic and religion are allowed, yet viewed skeptically by the
majority of folks. The Hands of the Wand and the Eyes of the Star keep the gatherings
small and manageable so that power isn't accumulated too quickly or in the wrong hands.
All in all, most of the people trust them to keep order, which they do generally with a
sense of justice and wisdom.
