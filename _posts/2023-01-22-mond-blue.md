## Backstory

He doesn't talk much, so we don't know much.

Update on Mond's background:

From Messenger Nov 5, 2024 (1:57 PM):

Sanjaya: He hid his magic until he couldnâ€™t and didnâ€™t matter in terms of getting singled out. No point living a lie so now he fully embraces his nature.

Dave: For Mond, I particularly like how his personality has evolved since Elsemar.

Dave: Coming into the city, he was quiet (I think because you were new to the game, but I like to imagine it's...) because he had always been told he had to hide his magical tendancies. 

Dave: Being a sorcerer in an anti-magic world isn't easy. People know that magic exists, but practitioners are criminalized. Mond isn't a wizard though, he was born this way.

Dave: Travelling through elsemar, he got his first real taste of anti-magic bigotry. More than just being told not to practice, he was tested and forced to wear a brand marking him as something unlawful.

Dave: But during that time he also met other folks who were similarly struggling, and was introduced to the bartender who runs an underground cleric thingie. 

Dave: Then he got onto what turned out to be a magic ship to leave the city for adventure, and to find himself.

Dave: He was free from the small mindedness of elsemar, and off on a quest that might just change the world's view of things.

Dave: Plus, he'd had enogh bigotry for a lifetime and was done putting up with that shit (Can you say "Fireball"?)

Dave: I dig how Mond now has zero patience for the zealots. And I assume that his somatic component (hand gensutres) for fireball is ðŸ–•

Sanjaya: Nice, since I always case it with careful I picture it as that hand gesture with lightning coalescing to plasma beyond  you guys so 4 or 5 feet from the extended middle finger
