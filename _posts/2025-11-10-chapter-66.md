Grindlefoot stands halfway between the entrance and the cavern's far wall, a one hundred foot distance. It's too
dark to tell how far the subterranean chamber extends to the north, beyond the maze of thick spider silk. The
southern wall is only twenty feet from the entrance. It appears to be about eighty feet to the ceiling, covered in
stalactites of varying shapes and sizes.

Standing at the entrance, the companions watch Grindlefoot respond to the giant spider's declaration. Rather, his
lack of response. The halfling's body remains motionless and he appears lost in thought, staring towards the
[giant spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16895-giant-spider) and the 
[spider dragon](https://5e.tools/bestiary/spiderdragon-veor.html) with a vacant look in his eyes.

The druid halfling is overtaken with memories of his life before adventuring. A life before discovering his talent
for druidic magic. A simple life. One with simple choices, simple problems, and simple solutions.

Grindlefoot remembers the farming community where he was born, raised, and grew to adulthood. Northeast of Wayside,
closer to the Jagged Sky mountains than the Ha-derech. Fields of grass and crops were surrounded by dense copses of
tall, leaf-filled trees. The soil was fertile and the different seasons arrived reliably, seeming to predict the
future with an accuracy the farmers relied on.

Even as a young halfling, he loved being outside, communing with nature, feeling the soil in his hands, and
encouraging the vegetables to grow in the tiny garden his Ma and Da created for him. It was obvious to them that
he had a knack for farming, but no one expected the future that came to be. Years later, his own farm would consistently
outperform his neighbors. The ears of corn were a little bigger and sweeter, the pods of peas were slightly more
sugary, the carrots were longer and a deeper orange, the onions and potatoes made the best soup in the region, and
even his lone apple tree yielded more apples than neighbors with a dozen or more trees. 

One day, he was trying to catch a stray dog who'd been digging up his radishes—no idea why, since dogs aren't
particularly fond of root vegetables—and the rascally canine outran and outmaneuvered the halfling at every juncture.
Without a conscious thought, Grindlefoot [Wild Shaped](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/635-druid-101-wild-shape-guide)
into a [wolf](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17062-wolf) and had the poor dog in his grasp within seconds
before realizing what had happened. Fortunately, he was alone on his farm with no one the wiser to his magical
nature. A few centuries had gone by since [The Uprising](/dnd/notes/appendix/#events), yet magic was still highly
discouraged and frowned upon in [Eritz](/dnd/assets/images/eritz-northern-hemisphere.jpg).

The next few years were spent discovering his [druidic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/3-druid) ways. It was an
exciting time of learning and discovery, yet filled with angst and concern. The more of his powers that he learned to
control, the more frequently he used them, and the more likely his magic use would be exposed to his neighbors. He
found that by concentrating in certain ways, he could shift into a handful of animal forms, such as the wolf, an
[ape](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16788-ape), a [warhorse](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17049-warhorse),
and even a [shark](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16994-reef-shark)—the fisherfolk still tell tales of seeing
it swimming in the river.

With no one to learn from, Grindlefoot had to teach himself through trial and error, mostly from his imagination
and intuition. One day, there was a traveling peddler passing by his farm who struck up a conversation with the halfling,
hoping for a sale. Noting the lushness of Grindlefoot's vegetables, they mentioned an old book about herbology that
was collecting dust in the back of their wagon. It turned out to be more than just a book about herbs; it had several
chapters about druids. The reverence they have for nature, how they use plants to cast spells, the deities they worship,
and the different circles, each granting a specific set of characteristics that expand a druid's abilities.

Over the years, he learned to wild shape more proficiently and could quickly transform into several different
animals. For some reason, he began to feel an affinity towards the [giant wolf spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5195033-giant-wolf-spider) and would often gravitate towards that form when practicing. The spider's form was agile, strong,
and gave the small halfling a confidence he didn't have in his natural form. Because he was inexperienced and lacked
someone to instruct him in the druidic ways, he didn't realize that an affinity can become akin to an addiction.
An unhealthy, psychic bond can develop between the druid and the animal form with unanticipated results.

On a particularly bright night, eerily lit by a harvest moon emanating a deep orange glow over the land, the halfling
found an empty meadow of wildergrass with several alder and birch trees peppered around it. A perfect place to practice
slinging his butt yarn, as he affectionally referred to the spider silk. During the early morning hours, underneath
the harvest moon, Grindlefoot the spider created a maze of webbing from one tree to another, alder to birch and birch
to alder, back and forth. He spun such a humongous web that he tired himself out and fell fast asleep underneath one
of the web-covered birch trees shortly before the pre-dawn light began to illuminate the meadow.

A neighbor on their way to town that morning saw the halfling asleep amidst the mass of spider silk and knew that the
rumors were true. Their very own Grindlefoot, whom everyone was so proud of for his farming skills, was a magic user.
This put everything in a different perspective. Once applauded for his bountiful vegetables and produce, the townfolk
and farmers began accusing him of not being a real farmer and, even worse, a menace to their community. It was time for
the halfling to leave his farm and community, to venture out into the world and continue his path as a druid.

Returning to the present, Grindlefoot looks at the spider dragon and the giant spider, wondering which one is the
voice in his mind. Perhaps both.

-->

<!-- Round 1 -->

Only a few moments pass while the companions huddle at the entrance, watching Grindlefoot stand still in thought.
The giant spider begins to move slowly towards the halfling and Dolor decides it's time to move. He rushes into
the chamber, towards the southeast, leaving twenty to thirty feet between him and Grindlefoot. Extending his arms,
a [ball of fire ](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618887-fireball) erupts from his hands towards a point halfway
between the two beasts. The fiery explosion engulfs them both and their shrieks of pain fill the cavern. The thick
fibers dissipate where the fireball struck, thinning out the webbing. A blinding light fills the pitch black chamber,
temporarily blinding Dolor and his companions. When their eyes adjust, the giant spider is perched behind
Grindlefoot and appears to bite him. The poisoned attack incapacitates the halfling and he falls limply to the floor.

Wondering how the spider moved so quickly, Mond casts [Slow](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619066-slow) at the
beast, but it shakes off the spell with no visible effect. The half-elf moves away from the entrance, towards the north
remaining close to the wall.

Gertrude, their new one-eyed, fifteen-foot-tall companion, immediately joins the fray. Swinging her greatclub
wildly about her, she rushes the large spider now standing over Grindlefoot's inert body. The first attempt goes
wide, but the second one connects with a solid thwack against one of its eight legs. The arachnid rescinds it
in obvious pain.

Turning to face Dolor, the giant spider spits a gooey substance at the tiefling. It lands on his bracer and begins
to eat away at the leather, creating a sizzling sound. Without raising his arm, Dolor quickly points at the spider
and it's [surrounded by hellish flames](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hellish-rebuke). Barely skipping a beat,
the creature turns to Gertrude and spews another stream of acid at the cyclops. She yells in fury and pain from
the attack.

Mond yells to the group, "I don't think this is a normal spider!"

Grindlefoot shakes off the effects of the poison and begins to sit up, unable to do anything more to help the others.

In a rush, the spider dragon moves it's monstrous body towards the entrance where Bilwin and Gven are standing. With
its dragon-like head extended to its full height, the creature stands fifty feet tall. Glaring down on its two
foes, the mouth opens and vomits thousands of tiny spiders at them. Covered in tiny, angry arachnids, the dwarf
and half-orc suffer inumerable bites and the toxic venom injected into their bodies.

Seeing her friends attacked, Gven embraces her
[barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/) and leaps at the
spider dragon with her Tempest Edge drawn. The greatsword seems like a tiny knife to the humongous beast, yet the
sword slices deep into first one then another of its legs. It roars in pain and takes a step to the side, moving
away from the half-orc's vicious attack.

Still covered in hundreds of small spiders, Bilwin thinks for a moment about how to follow Gven's strike. His mind
goes to his dwarven comrades from a time past and their unfinished quest for a piece of the
[Rod of Seven Parts](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Rod_of_Seven_Parts)—that
he only recently remembered. The cleric's jaw goes rigid with determination and a half-dozen
dwarves slowly appear around him. Their ethereal bodies
turn towards their old friend and he says to them, "The quest has not ended, my friends." They nod solemnly and
silently attack the mass of spiders, quickly clearing them from the dwarf's body.

Gripping his battle axe, Bilwin follows Gven into battle with the spider dragon and giant spider. He swings at
the spider dragon, taking a small chunk out of a leg.
His [spirit guardians](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619078-spirit-guardians) follow, attacking both of the
beasts. Their fierce attacks are executed without a single sound, except for the cries of agony from their two adversaries.

<!-- Round 1 damage:
  Bilwin - 24
  Dolor - 23
  Grindlefoot - 0, poisoned & incapacitated

-->

<!-- Round 2 -->

With the others engaged in close combat, Dolor draws Gleaming Blade and joins them. With a grunt of effort, he slices
through most of a leg and the spider immediately vanishes. Wondering where it went—and silently agreeing with Dolor
that this is no regular spider—the tiefling senses a presence behind him. Turning in time to see the creature emit a
puff of powdery substance, he feels the poison move through his body with unexpected quickness. Within seconds, the
rogue no longer has control of his body and slumps to the floor, incapacitated yet fully aware of the battle
surrounding him.

From his vantage point along the western wall, Mond raises a hand and a
[bolt of lightning](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618999-lightning-bolt) streams forth, hitting the spider
dragon in the space where its neck joins its body. Its piercing screech fills the cavern and beyond.

Gertrude appears to be in her element. With a beaming smile indicating her delight, the large cyclops rears back
and swings her greatclub with all her might, smashing against the giant spider's carapace. At least two of her
attempts are successful and the hurting spider remains in its place, not teleporting.

Having gotten its attention, the huge spider turns towards Gertrude and spews a stream of acid, followed quickly
by another. Both of them land on the cyclops's unclothed arms, causing the skin to bubble and burn away. She lets
out a deafening roar, of both pain and anger.

No longer paralyzed, Grindlefoot sits on the floor recovering his strength. The whispered words continue to pull
at him. "Why do you betray us, your brethren? Join us and our family. Defend yourself against these intruders."
He considers the request briefly, for only a mere moment before realizing the trickery of their words. Looking
up at the spider dragon in amazement after it spewed the mass of spiders at Gven and Bilwin, he wonders if he
could do that. More for physical effect than need, the druid blows a big puff of air at the spider dragon and
a [swarm of locusts](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619183-insect-plague) appears around it. They attack the
humongous creature with a ferociousness and determination only locusts seem to display. Rising to his feet, the
halfling moves quietly towards the eastern wall and away from the melee.

The spider dragon is badly hurt, but still extremely large and even angrier than before now that it's fighting
for its life. Taking its fury out on Bilwin, the beast lashes out with two of its legs, the sharp claws slashing
across the dwarf's chainmail armor. It completes the attack, biting the dwarf's shoulder and piercing the
heavy chainmail.

Seeing the spider dragon close to its end, Gven grips Tempest Edge tightly with both hands and moves closer to
the creature. She brings the greatsword up to her shoulder and begins to swing it in a wide arc behind and over
her head to gain momentum. As the magical weapon reaches the zenith of her swing's arc, the tall half-orc
throws her body forward at the spider dragon, increasing the speed of her attack. Tempest Edge slides into the
beast's body with ease, piercing its scaled hide all the way to the hilt. In that moment, Gven notices Bilwin's
spirit guardians around her, hands on her arms and body, as if guiding her to the weakest point in the spider
dragon's armor. She whispers her appreciation to them as she yanks her beloved sword from its vanquished foe.

With one enemy defeated, the giant spider begins to transform into an
[eldritch with tentacles](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2506152-eldritch-lich) for legs. It holds this form
for a few moments before turning into a gaseous form and starts to slowly move backwards, away from the companions.

Surprised by the spider's sudden transformation and escape attempt, Bilwin hurls a
[Guiding Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619136-guiding-bolt) at the vaporous entity. The attack passes
through it without any affect.
