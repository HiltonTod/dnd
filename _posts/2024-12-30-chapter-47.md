<!-- Guest player: Jolivette Shevitz as Dave Chevits -->

At the end of the fifty-foot long hallway, a wooden door with a heavy bar laid across
its front, preventing it from being opened. Dolor looks back to the others for approval
before lifting the metal beam from its place, securing the door—and whatever they'll find beyond it.

The rogue tiefling leads the group into a large room, 30 feet wide and 15 feet deep, that is ornately
decorated and lavishly furnished. Filling one corner of the room, is a four-post bed with a mountain of
sheets, comforters, and pillows that could comfortably fit four regular-sized humans, two half-orcs, or at
least six halflings. Along the west wall, an elaborate buffet, complete with gold filigre and
ornamental hardware, is laid out with all sorts of food delicacies and a fine choice of drinks.

Standing next to a leather-bound reading chair, one of a pair along the south wall, is a blond halfling.
Their hair falls below their shoulders, facial features are narrow and angular, slightly regal even,
and their body is slim yet sturdy. Wearing finely-made leather armor, they hold two large knitting needles,
deftly moving them while creating what appears to be a scarf.

"Please join me. It's been a long time since I've had visitors. Would you like some coffee, tea, or
perhaps a taste of wine? The cold brew is especially fine, one of my favorites." She indicates the
buffet to her left, filled with liquid and solid treats.

"My name is Dave Chevits, no relation to the less well known and infinitely less charming, David Shevitz.
They end their spelling with the letter Z, which is barbaric—no offense, my lovely barbarian." The halfling
gives a slight nod to Gven before continuing. "I like to get that out of the way. For some reason everyone
in Eritz thinks we're kin." Continuing to skillfully move her knitting needles, "What may I do for you fine
folks?"

Dolor is the first to recover his wits, "I'm curious, how did you get trapped beneath a ziggurat filled
with deadly creatures?"

"Oh, that's a long story. Not nearly enough time to get into that, my dears. Let's skip past the
pleasantries, although that's something David Shevitz would do and I'm loathe to be compared." They
grimace at the thought, but goes on. "I believe this is what you're looking for."

From underneath the enormous bed, the halfling pulls a blanket, then another, and then several more.
"As you can see, I've had quite a bit of time on my hands and I so enjoy knitting. Would anyone care
for a blanket? Guaranteed to be as comfy as the soft down fur of a baby bug bear." Continuing to search,
they pull bags of trinkets, jewelry, and coins.

Finally, reaching farther underneath the bed, Dave slides out a greatsword contained in a pitch black
scabbard. "Ah, here's what I'm looking for! I believe they call it Blackrazor."

Surprising the rest of the party, Gustaf moves forward and grabs the pommel to inspect it closer. He
slides the first foot out of its dark black scabbard, revealing the obsidian dragonscale blade
of the greatsword. Mond feels a strange, creeping dread come over him, as do some of the others, based
on their expressions of fear or misery. Gustaf sees their reactions and returns the blade to its
home, instantly relieving their overwhelming sense of dismay.

Grindlefoot looks around, "Why do you all look constipated? It's only a sword."

Gustaf looks to the halfling, "Did you not sense the blade's unmitigated desire to kill? Did you hear
the power in its voice? It filled my mind, urging me to attack all of you at once, to send you to the
void. Being an educated man of science and philosophy, it had no impact on my superior mind. Yet, it
sang glorious songs of battle, attempting to intimidate me, to convince me that I should attack you.
Alas, that is not my way."

Bilwin moves closer to Gustaf and reaches out to touch the sheathed sword, casting
[Identify](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2152-identify).
"Oh, it's very powerful! Whomever wields it in battle will have great advantages. And it's sentient!"

Gustaf sighed, "I already told you that."

"Yes, it's quite a magnificent blade, albeit, extremely dangerous to the wielder. Here are a few more
trinkets you might like to bring with you when we leave." Dave, the halfling, hands Dolor 100 platinum
pieces, 50 electrum pieces, a potion of greater healing, and a scroll of protection against fiends.
"What say you, shall we venture beyond this door and see what other excitement awaits?"

The group looks around at each other and Dolor finally speaks, "Who should carry that ensorceled sword?"

"I'll do it," Gustaf says quietly. "It's powers don't impact me like they do the rest of you. Besides,
if it does gain control I'd rather it not be in the hands of Gven or Dolor—or any of the rest of you,
for that matter. You'll have an easier time taking me down, if it comes to that." He grabs three scarves
from Dave's collection and fashions a knitted scabbard across his back. "There, that'll have to do."

---

The adventurers leave the halfing's small prison cell and as the door closes, the food and snacks
that Bilwin had stowed away in his clothes and backpack suddenly disappeared. "Aw, that's too bad.
I was looking forward to those scones with my beer, later. Let's go see that floating stream. I bet
it has all kinds of fancy floating fish or, maybe, there'll be sharks!"

The group returns the way they came, navigating the destruction of the ziggurat. "You sure were thorough
in here," Dave comments as they take in the water-logged carnage. They climb to the top level, exit
the ziggurat room, and make their way through the passage to the room with the stream and kayaks.

Floating two feet above the room's floor, the stream is only three feet deep, allowing plenty of space
between it and the room's ceiling. Several fish swim along with the current, most of them nondescript
and all of them uninterested in the spectators. The creek enters the room through an opening in the
west wall and leaves through one in the northeast corner, both with five feet of space between the top
of the water and the tunnels' ceiling. Bilwin sticks his arm into the water and feels it
pulling him inward, although he's able to keep his balance and position outside of the stream.

The group decides to see where the water goes and ties four of the kayaks together, hoping it will
keep them from getting separated with whatever they might encounter in the tunnel. Gven holds a
kayak up against the water, resting one end on the top of the stream while Grindlefoot and
Bilwin climb aboard. When they're ready, the barbarian lets go and they disappear into the tunnel.

Dolor and Dave Chevits are holding the second kayak in place. Gven quickly holds it up against
the stream, like the first one, allowing the tiefling and halfling to board and take off down the
waterway. Next, Mond and Gustaf follow the same pattern, allowing Gven to help them launch their
kayak. Gven's kayak is the last one in the line of boats tied together. She holds the narrow
boat up against the stream, quickly launches it into the water, and performs a twisting jump to
land inside and facing the proper direction. The rope at the bow pulls tight and her kayak moves
slowly with the current, into the dark tunnel ahead.

---

In the lead kayak, Bilwin and Grindlefoot move slowly into the deepening dark for a minute or longer,
before Bilwin touches the bow and casts [Light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618996-light). The
kayak begins to illuminate the bare tunnel walls, both above and below the water line. The riders
notice the current slowing even more as it encounters a slight incline. They hear rushing water
up ahead and within a matter of seconds, their boat hangs momentarily on the precipice of a drop into
the unknown ahead. The weight shifts forward and the narrow vessel shoots downward, gathering speed
with the current, turning to the left, then slightly to the right, and back to the left again.
The waterway levels out for a short space, drops further downward, jettisoning them forward even
faster, and then back upwards, until it finally flattens out. Grindlefoot can tell that they're headed
westward when they both see a light ahead.

The small boat with the halfling and dwarf enters a room and the floating stream takes a soft turn to
the left. As they peer around the room, they notice several warriors outfitted in black plate armor
standing off to each side of the stream. Before they can respond, their kayak rides the stream
through an exit on the other side of the room. Looking backward, Grindlefoot says, "I wonder who
they are and what they want?"

Following the first kayak, Dolor and Dave enter the room in their boat, only to discover a large
fishing net strung across the floating creek. They quickly become entangled in the rope prison and
unable to move. Looking around, they see warriors dressed in black armor surrounding them with swords
drawn. 

Dolor yells as loud as he's able, "It's a trap!"

Grindlefoot barely hears Dolor and then the rope attached to their stern goes taught. "Help me Bilwin,
we need to pull ourselves back to that room. I don't think those warriors are friendly."

Mond also hears Dolor's warning and turns to Gustaf, "prepare to jump as soon as we enter that room
up ahead. Keep that sword away from any battle, we don't want it persuading a random fighter to take
hold of it."

<!-- Round 1 -->

Further back in the tunnel, her kayak's bow tied to the stern of Mond and Gustaf's, Gven senses trouble
ahead—not that unusual, really—and readies herself for action. She sees the light of the room ahead and
the boat slows down with the current as it approaches the opening, allowing her a moment to take in the scene.
Dolor, Dave the halfling warrior, and their boat are tangled up in a large fish net, unable to move. Mond and
Gustaf are prone on the floor, attempting to upright themselves. Spread around the room are several
warriors dressed in black plate armor with their swords brandished, obviously meaning to attack. Where
the hovering stream exits the room, she can see the tip of a kayak re-entering the room, with Bilwin
and Grindlefoot pulling hard on the rope still tied to Dolor's kayak.

The half-orc barbarian dives from her kayak, rolling into a somersault on the ground, and then up into
a fighting stance. Pulling Tempest Edge from its scabbard, she invokes her
[barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/) and
attacks the warrior closest to her, who happens to be larger than the others. The greatsword glows
blue as the half-orc slashes her opponent's sword arm, first cutting between the bracer and rerebrace,
then on her backswing, slices their wrist, behind the gauntlet. They grunt in pain at the unexpected
accuracy of the large half-orc's strokes.

Towards the middle of the room, Dolor and Dave fight to detangle themselves from the wet rope cell.
The tiefling slices a few pieces and falls to the ground, momentarily free to look around and measure
their situation. The halfling isn't as fortunate and continues to struggle with the netting.

As Bilwin drops from the kayak to the stone floor, "Hanseath, I think we need a bit of help with this
crew. Mind [blessing](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618933-bless) them with a little something extra?"

The larger warrior winks at Gven and, although obviously in some pain from Tempest Edge's gashes, deftly
jabs at her thigh with his non-magical greatsword, drawing blood. Another warrior in black swings its sword
at Gven, but it goes wide the first time and then barely knicks her in the shoulder on the backswing.

A few feet away, one of the combatants attacks Mond, who smoothly ducks the first swing and deflects the
second. Next to the half-elf, Gustaf hasn't been able to move to safety and, fortunately, one of the
attackers swings wide and misses the fearful human. "I'm not here to fight! I'm a student of life, leave
me be!"

Two of the enemies in black move towards Bilwin and Grindlefoot, both unable to move away from their
attackers. The dwarf and halfling each receive minor cuts from their opponent's swords. Seeing Gven facing
a giant of an attacker, Grindlefoot casts [Haste](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2138-haste), giving
her additional attack speed and improving her ability to defend herself.

One of the warriors notices Dolor standing by himself and runs to attack with its sword brandished
high in front and slicing downward aggresively. The rogue's inherent
[Uncanny Dodge](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rogue#toc_10) allows him to move slightly and
avoid the brunt of the blow.

Mond is on his feet, facing two of the enemies, and casts
[Dissonant Whispers](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619104-dissonant-whispers), causing them
visible pain, although they don't run away. The sorcerer quickly follows up by quietly
casting [Shield](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2247-shield), protecting him for the next several seconds.

<!-- Round 1 damage:
  Bilwin - 9
  Dolor - 6
  Grindlefoot - 9
  Gven - 4+5+6
  Mond - 0
  Dave Chevits - 0
-->

<!-- Round 2 -->

"You're awfully cheeky for someone about to die," Gven whispers to the large warrior in front of her,
as she stabs them in the right shoulder, pulls back to remove her blade, and turns around in a blur for
a full-body swing of Tempest Edge aimed at their neck. The warrior moves backward, out of the
way. "We are blessed knights of the One. We do not die easily, especially at the hands of infidels."

The knight facing Gven is nearly as tall as her 6 foot 8 inches and even wider in the shoulders. With
a grimace across his oddly smooth face, he slides his greatsword forward, barely missing her left forearm.
On its return stroke, he moves the blade to his left, across Gven's arm and leaves a short opening in
her armor.

Dolor pulls Gleaming Blade from its sheath and slides it through the stomach of the black knight attacking
Dave Chevits, killing them instantly. Having a few moments to untangle themselves, Dave drops to the
stone floor, finally free from the corded cage. The other black knight attacks Dolor again, but with a
twist of Gleaming Blade, the tiefling deflects their weapon.

Pulling his hurdy-gurdy case from his back, Bilwin swings it roughly at the closest combatant, smashing
them upside their head and sending them backwards a step. A floating beer stein suddenly appears next
to the dwarven cleric. The [Spiritual Weapon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2263-spiritual-weapon)
sends a bolt of force towards the same warrior, causing them to stagger backwards even further.

Gustaf eludes a warrior's swing and makes his way to the edge of the room, hugging the wall while holding
the enchanted sword behind him.

The knight facing Mond swings with abandon, missing their target by a wide margin. The half-elf sorcerer
responds with a [Fire Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618890-fire-bolt) that propels his attacker
several feet in the other direction.

On the other side of the floating stream, Grindlefoot casts [Shillelagh](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2249-shillelagh)
on his staff and carefully enters into the fray. Spinning and kicking out his right leg, the halfing
targets behind a knight's knee, hitting them squarely in the bare spot between their plate mail. He follows
the kick with a smack of his staff, causing the warrior to grunt in pain.

<!-- Round 2 damage:
  Bilwin - 0
  Dolor - 0
  Grindlefoot - 0
  Gven - 6
  Mond - 8
  Dave Chevits - 0
-->

<!-- Round 3 -->

Gven suddenly feels the surge of energy from Grindlefoot's casting spell and launches a brutal attack
against the giant knight. Tempest Edge is a blur of movement as the half-orc carves pieces out of her
opponent's armor and flesh. It's all the knight can do to respond, missing with both swings of his
greatsword.

"You really need a better skin care routine. The stale air down here is wreaking havoc on your face."
The confused look on Gven's face prompts him to add, "I'm just saying, you need to take care of yourself."

Noticing the giant opposite Gven, Dolor disengages from his attacker, moves behind the large black knight,
and deftly plunges Gleaming Blade through the edge of his cuirass. "Tis but a flesh wound."

Close to Dolor, Dave Chevits pulls their large knitting needles from the narrow scabbards across their
back and takes a fencing stance. A knight notices the halfing warrior and swings their shortsword at them,
barely missing. Dave responds with a flurried attack, but is unable to land a blow on the wiggly knight.

Still brandishing his hurdy-gurdy case, Bilwin swings it at the same warrior—connecting for a solid hit.
The floating stein fighting alongside the cleric repeats its attack as well, causing a pained look on the
knight's face. They're not feeling well, at all, but they recover enough to stab the dwarf with their
shortsword. Bilwin gasps in pain, but stands in place, ready for the fight to continue.

Another of the knights advances on Dolor, reengaging from earlier in the battle, and slashes wildly
across the tiefling's back, drawing blood. Dave sees this and quickly moves to the tiefling's aid, poking
the black knight several times with their knitting needles. The knight gives the small warrior a look
of disgust.

Mond notices two knights standing close and casts [Fire Bolt](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618890-fire-bolt)
at them, enveloping them both in flames. They scream in pain, but remain standing and ready to fight.

Having moved into the fight, Grindlefoot throws a hard knee kick at his opponent and then jabs them
with his staff. His valient efforts aren't unnoticed, but they also don't cause significant pain.
Grindlefoot calmly considers his next option.

<!-- Round 3 damage:
  Bilwin - 0
  Dolor - 12
  Grindlefoot - 8
  Gven - 0
  Mond - 0
  Dave Chevits - 0
-->

<!-- Round 4 -->

Even with the increased speed from Grindlefoot's haste spell, the large knight is able to evade
Gven's flury of attacks with Tempest Edge. Slightly confused and mildly amused, she responds to
his comment. "To tell the truth, your skin is surprisingly wrinkle-free. Suggestions?"

With a grin, the muscular warrior takes a lengthy swing with his greatsword and catches Gven's
thigh on her right leg, drawing blood through her leather armor. "It's a special compound of all-natural,
organic ingredients that I apply twice a day. Any apothecary or herbalist who knows their stuff
can mix it for you." Another combatant sneaks in behind Gven, slashing her shoulder with their
shortsword, drawing even more blood. 

With his focus on Gven, the black knight doesn't notice Dolor in his blind spot. The tiefling's
blade slices through the knight's right calf and blood begins to flow from the wound. "I've had
worse," he says between gritted to teeth to Dolor.

Distracted during his attack, Dolor doesn't notice another knight to his left, whose long dagger
slides through his leather armor and into his skin. Responding without thinking, the tiefling
casts [Hellish Rebuke](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/hellish-rebuke) and the knight is immediately
surrounded by flames, screaming in pain.

Bilwin shift his weight and lurches forward with his hurdy-gurdy case, missing the shorter knight
in front of him. Meanwhile, the floating stein almost seems to laugh at the dwarf as it sends a powerful
burst of energy into the same attacker, causing it to kneel in pain.

The warrior halfing, Dave Chevitz, carves the air with his deadly knitting needles. Puncturing
one of the knights in their midsection. Close by, Mond hurls a mote of fire at another assailant,
dropping it to the floor, dead within seconds.

Grindlefoot is exasperated with the situation and unleashes a wave of
[thunderous energy](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619184-thunderwave) at the large knight
attacking Gven and three others in the blast's wake. The humongous black knight withstands
the onslaught, but the others are thrown backwards towards the wall, one landing hard on the floor
and not getting back up again.

<!-- Round 4 damage:
  Bilwin - 8
  Dolor - 7
  Grindlefoot - 13
  Gven - 13+4+7
  Mond - 11+12
  Dave Chevits - 0
  knights - 2 dead; 6 alive
-->

<!-- Round 5 -->

Suddenly and unexpectedly, Gven is overcome with fatigue. When Grindlefoot cast thunderwave, he
could no longer maintain the [Haste](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2138-haste) spell. The half-orc's
shoulders slump in exhaustion and Tempest Edge's blade lowers, leaving an opening for the black knight.
He sees his opening and takes advantage of the rare opportunity, adding another gouge to her left arm.

Gven throws a look at Grindlefoot, "Never again, halfling! I fight by my own powers, no one else's!"

With exceeding dexterity, Dolor spins to and fro with Gleaming Blade, slashing and stabbing three of
the knights in a few moments time. Revealing the finesse of an experienced rogue, he nimbly pulls his
second weapon, a shortsword, from it sheath at his side with his off-hand and finishes one of them.
Adrenaline pumping, the tiefling deflects another knight's attack and turns back to the large one facing
Gven.

The dwarven bard, Bilwin, continues his onslaught with the hurdy-gurdy case, beating a combatant across
their back. Next to him, floating in the air in a misty-like presence, the beer stein shoots another
burst of energy into the same knight, forcing them to the floor in agony.

Close to Dolor, Dave Chevits has decided to play with their opponent. A ball of yarn appears in the
petite warrior's hands and is suddenly being wrapped around their attacker. Within seconds, the knight
is tied up and unable to move. Dave's hands move to their hips and they strike a pose of triumph while
laughing at the warrior's feeble escape attempts.

Mond's hand turns to shadow as he moves to touch the warrior closest to him, attempting to
[siphon their life force](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619214-vampiric-touch). The warrior sees
the sorcerer and his shadowy hand, their face krinkles up in fear and they hastily recoil, avoiding
the necrotic affects of Mond's spell.

Resuming his melee attacks, Grindlefoot casts [Shillelagh](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2249-shillelagh)
on his staff again and focuses on a single knight. Spinning into position, then jumping for the height
advantage, the small halfling punches his opponent in the arm and follows up with a strike of his staff,
breaking their arm. Hearing Gven's comment, he casts [Healing Word](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619143-healing-word)
and demurely says, "Um, so sorry. I thought I was, um, helping?"


<!-- Round 5 damage:

Gustaf hurriedly updates the map in his leatherbound journal.
