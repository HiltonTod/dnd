After the group's short rest, it's early midday and the sun is shining, creating a natural
warmth found in the late spring season. The adventurer's follow Grindlefoot, in wolf form,
away from the Ha-derech, North towards the narrow trail that leads off into the forest and
the foothills of the Lower Jaw mountain range. His wolf's snout sniffs the trail, head
moving side to side and lifting up every once in a while to catch any air scents. 

It doesn't take long for the mood to alter, as the trees become denser, pushing closer to
each other, and creating a stillness in the air. The temperature drops significantly, even
though they know that the sun is shining and warming those who can feel its rays. The path
grows increasingly difficult to traverse, more like a game trail than one frequented by people.

After about an hour of walking, they discover that they're crossing the same stream
they did a short while ago. The creek's water disrupted the scent that Grindlefoot was
following and they inadvertently circled back. He's able to find goblin foot prints that
coincide with the doll's scent and they move forward. Soon enough, they discover additional
paw prints on the trail and Gven notices some scat, both of which belong to wolves. It
appears as though the trail is frequented by a local wolf pack.

They continue walking forward in a diamond shape, with Grindlefoot leading, Gven and Xantic
side-by-side, and Dolor bringing up the rear. Within minutes, Dolor hears significant
movement in the forest and brush around them as they come upon a large boulder, taller and
wider than Gven, that is blocking the trail about 20 feet in front of them. A large wolf
jumps to the top of the boulder and five more spread around its base, all of them growling
an audible warning and baring their teeth. Dolor knocks an arrow in his shortbow,
Grindlefoot prepares to defend himself, and Xantic lifts his loaded crossbow to his shoulder.

As a barbarian who follows the
[Path of the Totem Warrior](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#PathoftheTotemWarrior)
and chosen the wolf as her [Totem Spirit](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/barbarian#TotemSpirit-100),
Gven is well-tuned to the nature of animals. Embracing her
[animal handling](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#AnimalHandling) ability,
she senses that this pack of wolves is not aggressive, they're preparing to defend themselves
or their territory. She moves in front of Grindlefoot and holds out her arms in a peaceful
manner, calmly saying to the pack leader "we mean you no harm, we're just passing through,
trying to find someone who needs our help."

Suddenly, a figure drops from the trees above, landing softly and without a sound onto
the path in front of them, separating them from the wolves. They begin to speak in growls,
barks, yips, and whines. Within a few minutes, the wolves demeanor becomes less aggressive
and they slowly turn away, moving off into the surrounding forest.

The hooded figure turns towards the adventurers and they see that it's a female half-elf
with long, braided, dark hair. Silently and while watching them closely, she directs the
group to move backwards, away from the boulder. Once they're far enough away from the boulder
where they encountered the wolves, she smoothly jumps up onto a low branch and introduces
herself.

"I'm Lyra Swiftarrow and I keep track of things in this part of the wood; make sure those
who belong here aren't bothered by those who don't. That you didn't attack that pack tells
me you have some mettle about you. Their den is close by and they've been through a lot
lately, having lost four of their pack to those damned goblins up in the hills. I appreciate
you recognizing they were only protecting what's theirs and staying your weapons. Now,
what are you doing in my forest?"




Long rest....
