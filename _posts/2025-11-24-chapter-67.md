Standing in one of The Sanctum's many rooms, the companions turn to see the last few sparkles of the portal's
magic. Gven hears a scream off in the distance, beyond the portal's closing doorway, "Oh good lord, her club is
coming this way!" The barbarian grins at the havoc her one-eyed friend, Gertrude, must be reeking on Lolth's cultists.

Looking around the room, they find it scarcely decorated or furnished. A few small haphazardly placed
tables take up space on the floor, along with three bookcases along one of the walls. As their eyes adjust from
the absence of light in the underdark, Mond looks up to see the night sky where the ceiling should be. The sorcerer
blinks in disbelief before understanding the skill required to create such a conjuration. A
[spectral hand](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2173-mage-hand) floats around the room with a feather duster,
lazily going through the motions of its chore on the dust-free tables and shelves.

A woman enters the room from one of the open doorways, moving with the grace of a panther silently traversing tree
limbs in a forest. Her white blouse fits closely around her torso with puffy sleeves and is tucked into her
dark wool trousers. A navy blue vest rests over her frame and the bottom extends to her knees, with short tassels on the
edges. Leather pauldrons with articulated plates rest across each shoulder, matching leather braces cover her forearms,
and a belt around her waist completes the set. Attached to the belt are more than a few sheathed knives and a small
coin pouch.

"Thank the stars! Are you alright? Anyone stabbed, poked, sliced, ensorceled, or suffering from any other sort of ailment?"

Bilwin points to one of his many wounds and lilts to one side, "I've got a few that could use tending to."

"Oh, my dwarven friend, we'll see to those immediately. I'm
[Malaina van Talstiv](https://5e.tools/bestiary/malaina-van-talstiv-veor.html), Alustriel's wife, and I manage
all of the non-magical aspects of this manor. Let's get you to your rooms where you can bathe and rest before
dinner this evening." Looking at Bilwin, "Do not fear, mighty cleric, the journey is short and relief will soon
be upon you."

She hesitantly touches a handheld lamp on one of the tables, "I never know which one of these things is magical."
It begins to glow and then slowly lifts into the air, hovering. "Take them to their rooms and have the staff draw
their baths." Turning to the companions, "Follow the lamp. Rest and refresh yourselves before we join Alustriel and
the others for our evening meal."

---

The hovering lantern leads each of the companions to their own luxuriously appointed bower, including individual
bathing rooms and a claw-foot porcelain tub filled with steaming hot water. They each disrobe and leave their travel
clothes and armor in various states of disarray in their rooms. Slowly descending into the soothing comfort of the
hot bath, each one finds themselves considering events, both recent and long past.

Grindlefoot soaks in a small tub, one made for people of a smaller stature, such as himself, and thinks back to
those moments in the [spider dragon's](https://5e.tools/bestiary/spiderdragon-veor.html) lair. He felt torn between
his halfling and spider forms, as though they were both intimate parts of him. Why does he feel so attached to his
spider-self? Is it all those times he spent [Wild Shaping](https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/635-druid-101-wild-shape-guide)
into one? It always felt so natural, more so than the other forms. Should he have shifted into something more
appropriate for the bath? A duck? A crab? A crabduck? What would that even look like? A duck's head on a crab's body
with six webbed feet? That spider dragon was amazing. It could breathe smaller spiders!
He feels a sadness come over him as he lies back in the porcelain tub. He misses the spider dragon, or rather what it
meant to him, a strong connection to his spider-self.

Bilwin finds himself in a similar sized tub as his halfling companion, immersed in steaming hot water that is the
perfect temperature—neither too hot nor too cold. His belly-length beard floats just under the water's surface and
the cleric notices that his wounds are healed. Holding up his hands out of the water to inspect them, "That's a useful
piece of magic." The dwarf's mind also returns to the spider dragon's lair and the moment when his old companions
answered his [call for help](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619078-spirit-guardians). He's not quite sure how
that happened, but he needed them and called for them, and they came. Other memories return to him, albeit fuzzy
in the details. He doesn't know how many years ago their quest began, but he has a vision of the dwarven comrades
leaving their homeland together. They were searching for something important, vitally so, one of the pieces belonging
to the [Rod of Seven Parts](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Rod_of_Seven_Parts). But why did they need it?
What purpose was it to fulfill? And which piece were they looking for? Not the one his new companions recovered,
he's certain of that. Some of the empty spots in his memory have been filled, only to reveal more questions unanswered.

While Dolor unwinds and recuperates in the claw-foot tub with water at the ideal temperature, his mind wanders back
further in time. A moment inside the temple on Amonah, when a [djinnin](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16842-djinni)
fulfilled a hidden desire. The tiefling had wanted to be a rogue since he was a youngling, anxious to learn the ways
of stealth and agility, and how to expose a foe's vulnerabilities in almost any situation. But reality had been
more difficult than he anticipated. His arrows often flew wide of their intended targets, much to the chagrin of
any nearby rabbits. Climbing and traversing difficult terrain was often more difficult than he anticipated, especially
if a rope was involved. His insecurities grew while his companions seemed to improve their skills with each passing
day, getting more adept at swordplay, casting more complex spells, or calling on their deity with ease to answer
their prayers. Fenseck offered him an alternative approach, the magic of a [warlock](https://www.dndbeyond.com/classes/7-warlock).
Since that moment in the temple, he's become a strong and adept magic practioner. It comes naturally and he can
feel the strength coming from within, rarely failing him. He closes his eyes and a smile creeps onto his face.
It's good to have options, particularly one like [Fireball](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2618887-fireball).

Mond leans back against the hard surface of the porcelain tub, enjoying the water's perfect warmth enveloping
him. A feeling of peace encompasses the half-elf, in a way that it hasn't for quite some time. As a sorcerer,
magic is a part of his essence. It lives within him, whether he wants it to or not. In Eritz, magic is considered
an atrocity and something to be feared—meanings that he interpreted to define himself as well. Since entering
this new plane, Neverwinter and its lands, he's discovered a new perspective. Magic is accepted, embraced even.
He is accepted. In a way that has never felt so sincere before now. His eyelids gradually close and his breath reaches
a steady rhythm, while the water continues to soothe his body—and mind.

As Gven enjoys the impeccably heated water of her bath, she appreciates that Alustriel and Malaina have larger tubs
for those like her. It's a pleasant feeling to stretch out to her full length of almost seven feet, instead of
sitting with her knees and upper torso above the comfortable bath. Ah, Alustriel. And Malaina. Such beautiful
women. The half-orc opens her eyes a pinch to survey the room, hoping one or both of them might appear to join
her. Alas, not this time. She grins at the thought of how that encounter could unfold. And then her thoughts
turn to darker matters, Torp, her brother. Why is she here, in a distant land so far from home and fighting
for people she doesn't know. That seems to be a theme since leaving her home in The Badlands of Eritz. Someone—or
a group of someones—find themselves in a bad situation and she steps in to help. Of course, it's comforting that
her companions innately respond the same way. And if her nature is to help others in need, why is her brother's
the opposite? How did he become the person he is? Why does he feel the desire, the need, to force his beliefs
on others at any cost? When she encountered him in Elsemar, he seemed to authentically believe in his path,
that he was doing the right thing by ridding the world of magic users. How could he not see it for what it is,
genocide. The barbarian gently slides her head underneath the water's surface, escaping her troubling thoughts,
if only for one more moment of peace.

The companions gather in a sitting area located down the hallway and around a corner from their cluster of rooms.
Grindlefoot describes to the others the voices he heard in the spider dragon's lair, how they attempted to
lure him to their side. The halfing isn't sure if he heard the spider dragon or the
[yochlol](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Yochlol) in his mind, or maybe both. Regardless, it was
simulataneously unsettling and comforting, an odd combination. 

Bilwin is conspicuously quiet during their brief time together before being summoned to supper with the
wizards. Dolor notices the dwarf looking off into the hallway, eyes focused on nothing but his thoughts.

Malaina appears without warning, moving soundlessly through the manor's halls. She's changed into a lovely
dark blue floor-length dress with a fitted bodice. Featured prominently on each of her hips, decorative leather
sheaths embedded with tiny blue sapphires hold two knives with matching blue sapphires inlaid in their handles.

"I do hope you're all feeling rested and," looking at Bilwin, "healed after your baths. A full meal will do
you all a world of good."

The striking woman moves with an unnatural grace as she leads them through a succession of hallways to a
a great hall. Entering the large room, Mond is entranced by the luxurious tapestries that adorn the wood-trimmed
and stone walls. The table is laden with all manner of foods, as well as a variety of red and white wines.

Alustriel is already seated at one end of the lengthy table and Malaina takes a seat at the other, opposite her wife.
Her chair moves of its own accord, helping her sit as an invisible butler would. Mordenkainen and Tasha sit along
either side, also opposite each other, and in the middle of the table's length, forcing the companions to divide
themselves as they sit.

Mordenkainen looks at Mond, "Do you have it? I'd like to see it."

The half-elf sorcerer pulls the first piece of the rod from a hidden pocket inside his robes and hands it to the
arghmage.

Turning it over in his hands, Mordenkainen looks it over from every angle. "I feel its energy emanating, as though
it's a pulse." He suddenly smashes the artifact on the heavy, wooden table. The companions are astonished, but
Tasha and Alustriel appear unmoved. Speaking to no one in particular, "I had to verify it's authenticity."

Turning to Mond, "Did it tell you where to go next?"

"I had a vision when I touched it, but it's unclear to me. There was a large ship but no water surrounding it or
holding it afloat. It was not where I'd have expected a ship to be moored or sailing."

"The [Astral Plane](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/basic-rules-2014/appendix-d-the-planes-of-existence?srsltid=AfmBOoo2j2erujgnXIJNc7g-V6cGcU-y-h2q1taoTSIf7Y3jxCElvsJ3#TransitivePlanes), that's where you'll need to go."

Except for Mond, the companions appear confused and the mage explains, "It's a place between places where the laws
of reality bend in odd ways. You won't age there and you won't hunger for sustenance. The corpses of old, dead
gods—long forgotten by their worshippers—float through an endless, open domain. Their corpses are the size of planets,
inhabited by creatures such as yourselves, and not."

Alustriel adds, "It's a realm of thoughts and dreams, swirling mists and colorful fogs that create a silvery sea with
swirling wisps of white grey streaking among motes of light resembling distant stars. It's a beautiful place. A
dangerous place. It's peaceful. It's maddening. You will do well to proceed with caution. This journey should not be
taken lightly, it can be worse than deadly, an eternal life you do not desire."

The adventurers begin to pepper the archmages with questions. How do we breathe? Where do we go? How do we get there?
How do we navigate this vast area? What happens to others outside of the plane while we're there? Can we still drink
beer, Grindlefoot asks for the oddly silent Bilwin?

"All good questions, but not the ones you should be asking. While we will protect you as much as possible, you face
Vecna. Do you understand who he is?"

Mond and Dolor look at Alustriel with curiosity while Gven shrugs, as though what does it matter, and Grindlefoot
seems lost in thought—probably thinking about how he could turn into a combination of a duck and a crab. Bilwin
continues to be subdued, only Dolor seems to notice the substantive change in the dwarf's behavior.

Alustriel continues, "





Alustriel advises Mond, "Go, sit with the first piece of the rod and meditate. It will guide you."

_The adventurers advance to level 11._
