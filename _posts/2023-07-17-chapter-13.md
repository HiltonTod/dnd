Midnight has come and gone while the adventurers and Low Elves have defended the
village of Wayside from the first wave of the goblin horde. The Low Elves have been
protecting Scribbles & Nibs and Preva's Flowers, but the adventurers have been
focused on their own battles to save the Buzzin Bee...and the town and townsfolk.

They have little time to catch their breath before Dolor notices that a
[giant spider](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16895-giant-spider) is frantically
waving several of its legs from the top of a tree. "Ready yourselves, here we
go again!"

Fight choreography:

**Round 7**
*   15 goblins come out from the treeline and reveal themselves, 250 feet from the Buzzin Bee.
    *   5 of the goblins stop to fire their short bows at the heroes, all arrows missing their marks.
    *   10 of the goblins pass through the treeline and dash ahead 60 feet.
*   Dolor takes a long shot with his shortbow at one of the stationary goblins at the treeline,
    hitting his mark and killing it. "Huzzah!" he exclaims up to Cindel in the second story window.
*   Grindlefoot, as a giant spider, deftly climbs down his tree and bites one of the 4
    remaining goblins, killing it. Fortunately, he remembers to not drain the creature's blood
    before his spidery instincts take over.
*   Cindel fires her longbow at the closest goblins and misses.
*   Gven readies her two hand axes for short range throws, having thrown all 4 of her javelins.

**Round 8**
*   3 goblins at the treeline move ahead 30 feet and fire their shortbows, all missing.
*   10 closer goblins move ahead 30 feet and fire their shortbows, all missing.
*   Dolor fires another shot at one of the closer goblins, hitting it for 5 damage—it's now hobbling severely.
*   Grindlefoot shoots his web at one of the goblins close to him, missing wide.
*   Cindel fires two arrows in quick succession from her longbow, killing 2 of the closer goblins.
*   Gven holds, ready with her hand axes.

**Round 9**
*   3 goblins closest to the treeline move ahead another 30 feet and fire their shortbows, all missing.
*   8 closer goblins move ahead 30 feet and fire their shortbows at the defenders.
    *   Unfortunately, 3 arrows hit Dolor for 5, 3, and 4 piercing damage.
    *   The rest of the arrows miss, kathunking into the ground around Gven and the window frame protecting Cindel.
*   Dolor swigs a greater healing potion for 15 points of health.
*   Grindlefoot is too far from the closest goblins to attack and scrambles back up a tree to hold
    his position, keeping eight eyes out for more enemies coming from the forest to the North.
*   Cindel fires two more arrows at the goblins, killing one and missing another.
*   Gven continues to hold her ready position.

**Round 10**
*   _3 goblins alive at the 190' mark, and 7 goblins alive at the 130' mark._
*   3 goblins further away move ahead 30 feet, fire their shortbows and miss—shocking, I know.
*   7 goblins closer to Wayside move ahead 30 feet and fire their shortbows.
    *   Unfortunately, this time, two arrows connect with Cindel, causing 8 and 5 piercing damage.
    *   Dolor also gets hit by an arrow, receiving 7 piercing damage.
    *   The rest of the arrows miss.
*   Dolor fires his shortbow at the closest goblins and hits one, stopping it dead in its tracks—pun intended.
*   Gven yels up to Cindel, "need a healing potion up there?"
    *   "Yes," she groans loudly, "but I don't think throwing it from there will be any help and
        you're needed down there. Keep fighting."

**Round 11**
*   3 goblins farthest away move ahead 30 feet, fire their shortbows and—wait for it—miss.
*   6 closer goblins move ahead 30 feet and fire their shortbows, most of them missing.
    *   One arrow hits Dolor, causing 8 piercing damage.
    *   Gven takes one arrow for 2 damage.
*   Dolor misses with his shortbow then swigs a healing potion, receiving 11 healing points.
*   Grindlefoot senses something coming from within the trees to the North, but cannot tell if it's
    more goblins or something else.
*   Cindel, once again proving her prowess with her longbow, quickly kills 2 more goblins.
*   Gven's [barbarian rage](https://www.thegamer.com/dungeons-dragons-dnd-barbarian-rage-explained-guide/)
    has run its course, so she invokes it again while holding her position close to the Buzzin Bee.
*
